If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.

When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.\n\nThe spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful _dispel magic_ spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature\u0027s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature\u0027s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.\n\nIf you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.","duration":"Special","higherLevels":"","isCustom":false,"isRitual":false,"jsonType":"spell","level":9,"name":"Astral Projection","notes":"","pinned":false,"prepared":false,"range":"10 feet","school":"necromancy","type":"9th-level necromancy"}}],"subtypes":[],"toolProficiencies":[{"hint":"","level":1,"proficiency":"Choose 1 Artisan\u0027s or Musical"}],"unarmoredDefense":"Wisdom","weaponProficiencies":[{"hint":"","level":1,"proficiency":"all_simple"},{"hint":"","level":1,"proficiency":"Shortsword"}]}
