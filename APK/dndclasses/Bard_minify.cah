For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability:\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n\nSpell save DC \u003d 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\nSpell attack modifier \u003d your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\n\nRitual Casting:\nYou can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.\n\nSpellcasting Focus:\nYou can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells","level":20}],"id":"Custom571273ee-8d83-44d4-a5a2-5824219b9940","isFeature":true,"jsonType":"feat","level":1,"name":"Spellcasting","notes":"","type":"Feat"},"level":1},{"feat":{"descriptionModels":[{"description":"You can cast any Bard Spell as a ritual if the Spell has a ritual tag","level":1}],"id":"Custom6a4a4547-8b7f-4d94-abf1-c33bd1162f45","isFeature":true,"jsonType":"feat","level":1,"name":"Ritual Casting","notes":"","type":"Feat"},"level":1},{"feat":{"descriptionModels":[{"description":"You can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your Bard Spells","level":1}],"id":"Custome3157456-6aca-4471-8fed-18ee4a748ebd","isFeature":true,"jsonType":"feat","level":1,"name":"Spellcasting Focus","notes":"","type":"Feat"},"level":1},{"feat":{"descriptionModels":[{"description":"You can inspire others through stirring words or music.
