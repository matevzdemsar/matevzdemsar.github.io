{"descriptionModels":[{"description":"You can prepare and deliver deadly poisons, granting you the following benefits:\n\n- When you make a damage roll that deals poison damage, it ignores resistance to poison damage.\n\n- You can apply poison to a weapon or piece of ammunition as a bonus action, instead of an action.\n\n- You gain proficiency with the poisoner\u0027s kit if you don\u0027t already have it. With one hour of work using a poisoner\u0027s kit and expending 50 gp worth of materials, you can create a number of doses of potent poison equal to your proficiency bonus. Once applied to a weapon or piece of ammunition, the poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition. When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of your next turn","level":1}],"id":"Custom2645c907-58a3-4cf6-8f93-4321ced15b7b","isFeature":false,"jsonType":"feat","level":1,"name":"Poisoner [TCE]","notes":"","type":"Feat"}
