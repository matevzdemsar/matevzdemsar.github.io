If the attack hits, you roll a d8 and add the number rolled as a bonus to the attack\u0027s damage roll. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, but a use is expended only if the attack hits. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest","level":1}],"id":"Custom58098920-69c8-4d9f-ad11-f23743016f81","isFeature":false,"jsonType":"feat","level":1,"name":"Squire of Solamnia [DSDQ]","notes":"","type":"Feat"}
