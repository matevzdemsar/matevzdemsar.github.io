Once you cast this spell in this way, you can\u0027t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast this spell using spell slots you have. The spell\u0027s spellcasting ability is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma when you cast it with this feat (choose when you gain the feat).\n\n- Protective Wings: You can manifest protective wings that can shield you or others. When you or another creature you can see within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can use your reaction to manifest spectral wings from your back for a moment. You grant a bonus to the target\u0027s AC equal to your proficiency bonus against that attack roll, potentially causing it to miss. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest","level":1}],"id":"Customddd811f4-aa37-42ec-a5d5-693cf5e12c2a","isFeature":false,"jsonType":"feat","level":1,"name":"Gift of the Metallic Dragon [FTD]","notes":"","type":"Feat"}
