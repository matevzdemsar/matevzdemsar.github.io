You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.\n\nYou can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you. Roll a d20, and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours.\n\nIf more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.\n\nYou regain your expended luck points when you finish a long rest","level":1}],"isFeature":false,"jsonType":"feat","level":1,"name":"Lucky","notes":"","type":"Feat"}
