Upon reaching 10th level, such a character has a 10 percent chance of gaining an epic boon. If the character fails to gain a boon, they have a 10 percent chance the next time they gain a level.\n\nIf the character gains a boon, the GM chooses it or determines it randomly. The character also permanently loses one of their Hit Dice, and their hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to a roll of that die plus their Constitution modifier (minimum reduction of 1). This reduction can\u0027t be reversed by any means","level":10}],"id":"Custom5af225fd-421c-4566-9da5-8a882b3587c8","isFeature":false,"jsonType":"feat","level":1,"name":"Aberrant Dragonmark [EB]","notes":"","type":"Feat"}
