If your destination space is too small for you to occupy, the teleportation fails and is wasted. Once you teleport in this way, you can\u0027t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher to do it again","level":4}],"id":"Custom97be967c-ecdf-4b16-a0dc-a826a8038ab3","isFeature":false,"jsonType":"feat","level":1,"name":"Strixhaven Mascot [SCC]","notes":"","type":"Feat"}
