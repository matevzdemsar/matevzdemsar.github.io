The creature that dealt damage to you must make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat). On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 force damage and is pushed up to 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn\u0027t pushed. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest","level":1}],"id":"Customd5b6ec11-3571-4d01-8f57-51f116d191f1","isFeature":false,"jsonType":"feat","level":1,"name":"Gift of the Gem Dragon [FTD]","notes":"","type":"Feat"}
