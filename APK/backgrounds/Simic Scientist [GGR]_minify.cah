Knowing where the information can be found doesn\u0027t automatically enable you to learn it; you might need to offer bribes, favors, or other incentives to induce people to reveal their secrets.\n\nYour DM might rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an inaccessible place, or that it simply can\u0027t be found.
