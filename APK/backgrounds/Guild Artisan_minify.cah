In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings. Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild\u2019s coffers. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild\u2019s good graces.","level":1}],"isFeature":true,"jsonType":"feat","level":1,"name":"Guild Membership","notes":"","type":"Feat"},"level":1}],"goldPieces":15,"jsonType":"background","languages":[{"description":"Choose 1","shouldSelect":true}],"name":"Guild Artisan","skills":[{"amountOfChoice":1,"id":"3683cd6e-474f-482a-9e07-01f7f18c8583","skills":[{}],"skillsModels":[{"name":"Insight","typeName":"SKILL"}]},{"amountOfChoice":1,"id":"1d7a7050-da3d-4bbf-ae86-c85c4bdd8faf","skills":[{}],"skillsModels":[{"name":"Persuasion","typeName":"SKILL"}]}],"tools":[{"description":"Choose 1 Artisan Tool","shouldSelect":true}],"weapons":[]}
