The worm latches onto the target's skin unless the target succeeds on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. The worm is a Tiny Undead with AC 6, 1 hit point, a 2 (-4) in every ability score, and a speed of 1 foot. While on the target's skin, the worm can be killed by normal means or scraped off using an action (the spawn can use Burrowing Worm to launch a scraped-off worm at a Humanoid it can see within 10 feet of the worm). Otherwise, the worm burrows under the target's skin at the end of the target's next turn, dealing 1 piercing damage to it. At the end of each of its turns thereafter, the target takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage per worm infesting it (maximum of 1 Od6), and if it drops to 0 hit points, it dies and then rises 10 minutes later as a spawn of Kyuss. If a worm-infested target is targeted by an effect that cures disease or removes a curse, all the worms infesting it wither away.","id":-1,"isLegendary":false,"monsterId":-1,"name":"Burrowing Worm","type":"NONE"}],"alignment":"Chaotic Evil","burrowSpeed":0,"cha":3,"climbSpeed":0,"con":18,"conditionImmunities":"exhaustion, poisoned","cr":"5","damageImmunities":"poison","dex":11,"flySpeed":0,"hp":{"constant":36,"diceAmount":9,"diceType":"D8"},"id":-1,"int":5,"isLocked":true,"jsonType":"monster","languages":"understands the languages it knew in life but can't speak","name":"Spawn of Kyuss [MoM]","resistances":null,"savingThrows":"Wis +1","senses":"darkvision 60 ft.","size":"Medium","skills":null,"specialTraits":[{"description":"The spawn of Kyuss regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or a body of running water.
