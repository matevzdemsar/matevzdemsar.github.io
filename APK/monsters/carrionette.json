Unless the target is protected by a protection from evil and good spell, it must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or have its consciousness swapped with the carrionette. The carrionette gains control of the target's body, and the target is unconscious for 1 hour, after which it gains control of the carrionette's body. While controlling the target's body, the carrionette retains its Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It otherwise uses the controlled body's statistics, but doesn't gain access to the target's knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.\n\nIf the carrionette's body is destroyed, both the carrionette and the target die. A protection from evil and good spell cast on the controlled body drives the carrionette out and returns the consciousness of both creatures to their original bodies. The swap is also undone if the controlled body takes damage from the carrionette's Silver Needle.","id":-1,"isLegendary":false,"monsterId":-1,"name":"Soul Swap","type":"NONE"}],"alignment":"True Neutral","burrowSpeed":0,"cha":14,"climbSpeed":0,"con":12,"conditionImmunities":"charmed, frightened, poisoned","cr":"1","damageImmunities":null,"dex":15,"flySpeed":0,"hp":{"constant":6,"diceAmount":6,"diceType":"D6"},"id":-1,"int":8,"isLocked":true,"jsonType":"monster","languages":"understands the languages of its creator","name":"Carrionette","resistances":"poison, psychic","savingThrows":null,"senses":null,"size":"Small","skills":null,"specialTraits":[{"description":"If the carrionette is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll.
