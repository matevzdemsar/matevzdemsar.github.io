While attached, the necrichor takes only half damage dealt to it (round down), and the target takes the remaining damage. The necrichor can attach to only one creature at a time.\n\nThe attached necrichor can telepathically control the target's move, action, or both. When controlled this way, the target can take only the Attack action (necrichor chooses the target) or the Dash action. The attached target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, detaching from the necrichor and forcing it to move into the nearest unoccupied space on a success.","id":-1,"isLegendary":false,"monsterId":-1,"name":"Blood Puppeteering (Recharge 6)","type":"NONE"}],"alignment":"True Neutral","burrowSpeed":0,"cha":10,"climbSpeed":20,"con":17,"conditionImmunities":"blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, poisoned, prone, restrained","cr":"7","damageImmunities":null,"dex":15,"flySpeed":0,"hp":{"constant":27,"diceAmount":9,"diceType":"D8"},"id":-1,"int":17,"isLocked":true,"jsonType":"monster","languages":"any three languages, telepathy 120 ft.","name":"Necrichor","resistances":"acid, necrotic","savingThrows":"Con +6, Int +6, Wis +4","senses":"blindsight 120 ft.
