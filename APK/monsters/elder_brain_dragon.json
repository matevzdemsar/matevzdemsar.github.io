Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a success or failure, if the creature isn't a Construct or an Undead, it becomes infested with illithid tadpoles.\n\nWhile infested, the creature takes 16 (3d10) psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself after it succeeds on three of these saves. If the creature is targeted by magic that ends a curse or restores 40 hit points or more, the tadpoles infesting the creature are killed instantly, ending the effect on the creature.\n\nIf a Humanoid is reduced to 0 hit points while infested, the creature is stable but remains unconscious for 6d12 hours. When the period of unconsciousness ends, the creature transforms into a mind flayer (see the bestiary) with all its hit points. Casting a wish spell on the unconscious creature rids it of the infestation and prevents it from turning into a mind flayer.","id":-1,"isLegendary":false,"monsterId":-1,"name":"Tadpole Brine Breath (Recharge 5-6)","type":"NONE"},{"description":"The dragon makes one Tentacle attack.","id":-1,"isLegendary":true,"monsterId":-1,"name":"Tentacle","type":"NONE"},{"description":"The dragon targets a creature it is grappling.
