The wind vortex is a 30-foot-radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Each creature other than the cradle in that area must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 71 (11d12) bludgeoning damage and has the restrained condition within the vortex. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space outside the cylinder. The vortex lasts until the start of the cradle's next turn. A creature with the restrained condition falls prone when the vortex ends.\n\nA creature with the restrained condition can use its action to try to escape the vortex. The creature makes a DC 19 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.
