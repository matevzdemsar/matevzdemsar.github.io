Hit: 6 (1d4 + 4) slashing damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it suffers a lingering wound that causes it to take 7 (2d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. Each time the slasher hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 3 (1d6). The wound ends if the target regains hit points or if a creature uses an action to stanch the wound, which requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check.","id":-1,"isLegendary":false,"monsterId":-1,"name":"Slasher's Knife","type":"MELEE_OR_RANGED"},{"description":" 7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/60 ft., one target.
