You can have up to three such devices active at one time. You may reclaim the parts used to create the device once it stops functioning, only if it did not explode. When you create a device, choose one of the following options:\n\n- Arsonist's Friend: A small brass rod with a slit at the top and a button on the side. When the button on the device is pushed roll 1d6. On an even roll, the device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. On a roll of one, the device explodes causing 1d4 fire damage to the user.\n\n- Blast Orb: The device is a small brass orb that makes a ticking sound once a small button on the top is pressed. One round after the button at the top is pressed the device explodes in a 5-foot radius dealing 1d8 fire damage to anything within it. If the device is destroyed, nothing happens.\n\n- Bomb Boy: A clockwork tiny construct that is in the form of a goblin. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in the direction it is facing making a loud wailing sound as it walks. When it is destroyed roll a d20. On a roll of 12 or higher, the object explodes in a sphere five feet in diameter dealing 1d4 piercing damage.","level":1}],"isFeature":true,"jsonType":"feat","level":1,"name":"Dangerous Tinker","notes":"","type":"Feat"},"level":1}],"weaponProficiencies":[]}],"toolProficiencies":[],"traits":[{"feat":{"descriptionModels":[{"description":"You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
