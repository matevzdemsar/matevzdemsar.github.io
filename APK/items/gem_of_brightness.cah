{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:\n\n- The first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn\u0027t expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.\n- The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n- The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.\n\nWhen all of the gem\u0027s charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.","effects":[{"charges":50,"id":"40faacd5-83bb-4a39-a8f2-392a0628d97b","name":"Charges","rechargeMoment":"MANUAL","rechargeRate":{"constant":0,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Gem_of_Brightness","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Gem of Brightness","rarity":"UNCOMMON","requiresAttunement":false,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":1.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
