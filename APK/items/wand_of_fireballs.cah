{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the fireball spell (save DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.\n\nThe wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand\u0027s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"124","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":7,"id":"342aa8c3-43a8-476a-be85-e18b725a5f6d","name":"Cast Fireball","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":1,"diceType":"D6"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Wand_of_Fireballs","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Wand of Fireballs","rarity":"RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WAND","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":1.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
