As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge and slam this hammer on the ground, creating a 15-foot-radius circle of glowing runes centered on the point of impact. While you\u0027re inside that area, your hammer glows with matching runes, and you gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this hammer. The rune circle disappears after 1 minute, when you create another rune circle, or when you dismiss the rune circle as a bonus action. This hammer regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.","effects":[{"charges":3,"id":"80d9c64d-0087-4f5d-b948-6355d7f28b4a","name":"Slams Left","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":0,"diceAmount":1,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"PASSIVE"}],"id":"item_Hammer_of_Runic_Focus","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":true,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Hammer of Runic Focus","rarity":"VERY_RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WEAPON","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":2.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
