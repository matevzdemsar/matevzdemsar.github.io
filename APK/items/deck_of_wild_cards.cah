{"id":"item_Deck_of_Wild_Cards","name":"Deck of Wild Cards","description":"This deck of heavy vellum cards hums with the magic of the Elemental Chaos.\n\nThe magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (a deck of real-world playing cards can simulate the deck). As an action, you can draw a random card from this deck and throw it to make a ranged spell attack, using Dexterity for the attack roll. The card has a range of 30 feet. On a hit, it deals 1d4 slashing damage and imposes a magical effect determined by its suit, as detailed in the Deck of Wild Cards table. The card immediately returns to the deck after it hits or misses a target.\n\nDeck of Wild Cards\nd4 --> Suit --> Effect\n1 --> ♣ (Rods) --> The card explodes in a burst of fire. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 2d8 fire damage.\n2 --> ♦ (Coins) --> The card shoots streaks of lightning. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the blinded condition until the end of your next turn, and each creature within 10 feet of the target takes 1d6 lightning damage.\n3 --> ♥ (Cups) --> The card covers the target in a thick layer of ice.
