{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"If you die while wearing this gray crystal ring, you vanish and reappear in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the space you left (or the nearest unoccupied space). You have a number of hit points equal to 3d6 + your Constitution modifier. If your hit point maximum is lower than the number of hit points you regain, your hit point maximum rises to a similar amount. If you have any levels of exhaustion, reduce your level of exhaustion by 1. Once the ring is used, it turns to dust and is destroyed.","effects":[],"id":"item_Ring_of_Temporal_Salvation","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Ring of Temporal Salvation","rarity":"RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"RING","value":2500.0,"valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":1.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
