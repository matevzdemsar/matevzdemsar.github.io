{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This strange pistol resembles a flask with a honeycomb of tubes sticking out its front. The weapon is powered by an energy cell stored at the base of the flask. Placing a full energy cell in the pistol gives the pistol 10 charges.\n\nAs an action while holding this pistol, you can expend 1 of its charges to fire a burst of glowing, needlelike darts from the pistol in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 8d4 piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nReplacing the Energy Cell:\n\nWhile the pistol has charges remaining, its energy cell can\u0027t be removed. Once the pistol has 0 charges, you can replace the energy cell with a new cell by using an action or a bonus action.","effects":[],"id":"item_Needler_Pistol","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":false,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Needler Pistol","rarity":"NONE","requiresAttunement":false,"type":"ADVENTURING_GEAR","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
