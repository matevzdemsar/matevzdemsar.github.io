{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"Nature can\u0027t abide the book\u0027s presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.\n\nA creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book\u0027s contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.\n\nWhenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature\u0027s alignment changes to neutral evil.\n\nThe Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can\u0027t be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.\n\nRandom Properties\nThe Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties:\n\n- 3 minor beneficial properties\n- 1 major beneficial property\n- 3 minor detrimental properties\n- 2 major detrimental properties\n\nAdjusted Ability Scores\nAfter you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can\u0027t adjust your ability scores again.\n\nMark of Darkness\nAfter you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.\n\nCommand Evil\nWhile you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the dominate monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can\u0027t use this property again until the next dawn.\n\nDark Lore\nYou can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check.\n\nDark Speech\nWhile you carry the Book of Vile Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite word from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage.\n\nDestroying the Book\nThe Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.\n\nIf a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.\n\nA creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 Ã— 100 years later.\n\nIf all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"172","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"43ce4516-9d78-4aa5-a8a4-ddc9a666b456","name":"Cast Dominate Monster","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Book_of_Vile_Darkness","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Book of Vile Darkness","rarity":"ARTIFACT","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":5.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
