{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This thick, fur-lined cloak has the frost rune stitched on the hem in silvery blue thread. Frigid wind swirls around the cloak, regardless of the weather.\n\nWhile wearing this cloak, you have resistance to cold damage. Additionally, when you move within 5 feet of a creature, you can cause the cloak\u0027s cold wind to buffet the creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 cold damage and have the prone condition. A creature can be affected by the mantle only once during a turn.\n\nInvoking the Rune\nAs an action, you can invoke the mantle\u0027s rune to cast the sleet storm spell (save DC 14) with it. When you use the mantle to cast the spell, the area of the spell isn\u0027t 3 for you, and you can see through the storm, ignoring the normal penalties of a heavily obscured area.\n\nOnce the rune has been invoked, it can\u0027t be invoked again until the next dawn.","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"144","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"9a9f257d-94f1-4275-ac95-108f6595b2da","name":"Invoke Rune","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Mistral_Mantle","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Mistral Mantle","rarity":"VERY_RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
