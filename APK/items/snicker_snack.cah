{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic vorpal sword. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.\n\nWhen you use this weapon to attack a creature that has at least one head and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature’s heads. The creature dies if it can’t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, it doesn’t have or need a head, it has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.\n\nWhile attuned to Snicker-Snack, you have proficiency with greatswords, and you can use your Charisma modifier instead of your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.\n\nSentience: Snicker-Snack is a sentient, chaotic good greatsword with an Intelligence of 9, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. It can speak, read, and understand Common, and its voice sounds silvery and melodic. Snicker-Snack craves the destruction of evil Dragons and urges you to seek out these creatures and slay them.\n\nSnicker-Snack has a fickle personality. It ends its attunement to you if you miss on attack rolls with the weapon three times in a row. Each time you finish a long rest after that happens, you can attempt to regain the sword’s trust by making a contested Charisma check against Snicker-Snack. If you win the contest, your attunement to the weapon is instantly restored. Your attunement to the weapon can’t be restored in any other way.","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"bonus":3,"type":"SET_ATTACK","typeStr":"SET_ATTACK"},"id":"8c91d999-91d7-4d59-adff-8a240360ecb0","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"bonus":{"constant":3,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"damageType":"Slashing","type":"SET_DAMAGE","typeStr":"SET_DAMAGE"},"id":"5704e7c9-e172-4146-bfa5-fab0abc66230","name":"+3 Dmg, ignore slashing res.","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Snicker-Snack","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":true,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Snicker-Snack","rarity":"LEGENDARY","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WEAPON","value":0.0,"valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":12.0,"weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
