{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand\u0027s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.\n\nCommand\nWhile holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and command another creature to flee or grovel, as with the command spell (save DC 15).\n\nCone of Fear\nWhile holding the wand, you can use an action to expend 2 charges, causing the wand\u0027s tip to emit a 60-foot cone of amber light. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can\u0027t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can\u0027t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevent it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.","effects":[{"charges":7,"id":"c099083c-f09c-4cf6-b59b-05e8285345d5","name":"Charges","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":1,"diceType":"D6"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Wand_of_Fear","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Wand of Fear","rarity":"RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WAND","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":1.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
