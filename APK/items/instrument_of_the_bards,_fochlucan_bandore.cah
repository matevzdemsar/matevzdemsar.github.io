{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.\n\nYou can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can\u0027t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.\n\nYou can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.\n\nAll instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: fly, invisibility, levitate, and protection from evil and good.\n\nIn addition, the Fochlucan bandore can be used to cast entangle, faerie fire, shillelagh, and speak with animals.","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"125","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"267c2f68-b107-4f32-9282-b2ede7ca133c","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"219","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"6539874d-e60b-4685-a0fc-e2a51b8ac4ef","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"287","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"b1db231a-fa1f-4fb5-a84e-82bccf6a59f6","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"62","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"4165ada9-023e-4b42-af15-98f3e7e1ad45","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"27","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"079faf71-eb0f-460a-bb50-b7efd5185574","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"28","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"6279adba-e310-4c0c-bbea-5c17c008a210","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"73","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"4e5612ae-7fc8-40c9-9562-7625c4948dc8","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"78","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"f547b57c-8de3-484c-8c6b-a4c11a683d24","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Instrument_of_the_Bards,_Fochlucan_Bandore","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Instrument of the Bards, Fochlucan Bandore","rarity":"UNCOMMON","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"INSTRUMENT","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":2.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
