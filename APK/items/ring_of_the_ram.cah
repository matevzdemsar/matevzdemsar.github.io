While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of its charges to make a ranged spell attack against one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The ring produces a spectral ram\u0027s head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10 force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.\n\nAlternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring\u0027s charges as an action to try to break an object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn\u0027t being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge you spend.","effects":[{"charges":3,"id":"01ba152e-c357-4e79-bfc6-0e308a8147ae","name":"Charges","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":0,"diceAmount":1,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Ring_of_the_Ram","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Ring of the Ram","rarity":"RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"RING","value":null,"weight":null,"valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
