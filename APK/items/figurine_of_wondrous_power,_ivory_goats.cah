{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"A figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn\u0027t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn\u0027t become a creature.\n\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.\n\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can\u0027t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine\u0027s description.\n\nIvory Goats.\n\nThese ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:\n\n- The goat of traveling can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can\u0027t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.\n- The goat of travail becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u0027t be used again until 30 days have passed.\n- The goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can\u0027t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 lance, and the other becomes a +2 longsword. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat\u0027s aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can\u0027t be used again until 15 days have passed.","effects":[{"charges":24,"id":"1b01e4bf-b57f-4377-adb6-f8812f11d854","name":"Goat of Travelling Uses","rechargeMoment":"MANUAL","rechargeRate":{"constant":24,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"charges":1,"id":"626b3aa1-1ec3-47b7-8641-63f25491b192","name":"Goat of Travail Uses","rechargeMoment":"MANUAL","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"charges":1,"id":"01ceb927-e949-4d61-8884-422af5a7d138","name":"Goat of Terror Uses","rechargeMoment":"MANUAL","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Figurine_of_Wondrous_Power,_Ivory_Goats","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Figurine of Wondrous Power, Ivory Goats","rarity":"RARE","requiresAttunement":false,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
