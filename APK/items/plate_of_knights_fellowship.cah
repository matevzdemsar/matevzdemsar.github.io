{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This gleaming set of silver-and-gold plate armor never tarnishes.\n\nWhile wearing this armor, you can use a bonus action to summon the spirit of a warrior to your aid. The spirit\u0027s corporeal form manifests in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you, and it uses the knight stat block. The spirit disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or after 1 minute, whichever comes first.\n\nThe spirit is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the spirit shares your initiative count but takes its turn immediately after yours. The spirit obeys your commands (no action required by you); if you don\u0027t issue any commands, the spirit takes the Dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.\n\nOnce this bonus action is used, it can\u0027t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nPlate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.","effects":[{"charges":1,"id":"4ec6298c-45e7-4c02-b350-dd2d8f150cab","name":"Uses Left","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"PASSIVE"}],"id":"item_Plate_of_Knight\u0027s_Fellowship","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":true,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Plate of Knight\u0027s Fellowship","rarity":"UNCOMMON","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"ARMOR","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":65.0,"weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
