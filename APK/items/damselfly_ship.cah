{"id":"item_Damselfly_Ship","name":"Damselfly Ship","description":"This swift but cramped ship is made mostly of metal. It can't float on water, but its legs enable it to land safely on the ground. A sliding hatch just behind the wings allows access to the ship's mangonel turret. The ship's cargo hold can easily be turned into crew cabins or another weapon deck.\n\nDamselfly ships are often used as courier vessels and armored transports. Explorers and pirates like them because they're fast and sturdy. Military leaders use them as command ships for the same reasons.\n\nDamselfly ship owners are a proud lot, fond of painting their ships in colorful patterns as well as customizing their vessels with special equipment. Large, private gatherings of damselfly ship owners are not uncommon; they use these get-togethers to show off their ships and to race one another through asteroid belts and other obstacle courses, either for rewards or bragging rights.","value":2000.0,"valueCoin":"pp","weight":null,"weightUnit":"lb","rarity":"None","type":"Vehicle (Space)","isAmmunition":false,"ammunitionType":null,"isMagic":false,"isCursed":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"requiresAttunement":false,"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"attunedName":null,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"effects":[],"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"jsonType":"item"}
