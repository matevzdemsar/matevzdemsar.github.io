{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This magic ranged weapon is a flared pistol with the storm rune engraved along the barrel. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It requires no ammunition, its damage is thunder instead of piercing, and it doesn\u0027t have the loading property.\n\nInvoking the Rune\nAs a bonus action, you can invoke the weapon\u0027s rune to launch a ball of energy to a point you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The energy then detonates into a 10-foot-radius sphere of turbulent wind and thunder centered on that point, and each creature in that sphere must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 thunder damage, and it can\u0027t take reactions until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.\n\nOnce the rune has been invoked, it can\u0027t be invoked again until the next dawn.\n\nIt\u0027s up to you to decide whether a character has proficiency with a firearm. During their downtime, characters can train to acquire proficiency, assuming that they have enough ammunition to keep the weapons working while mastering their use.","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"bonus":1,"type":"SET_ATTACK","typeStr":"SET_ATTACK"},"id":"b0168272-1166-4037-9a72-4cf06ce6586a","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"bonus":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"damageType":"Magic","type":"SET_DAMAGE","typeStr":"SET_DAMAGE"},"id":"c8aa408a-da78-4d45-be38-c95b785162ee","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"charges":1,"id":"b5128488-5875-4269-a07e-568dab3eeeab","name":"Invoke Rune","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"PASSIVE"}],"id":"item_Thunderbuss","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":false,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":true,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Thunderbuss","rarity":"VERY_RARE","requiresAttunement":false,"type":"WEAPON","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":3.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
