{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.\n\nYou can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can\u0027t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.\n\nYou can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.\n\nAll instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: fly, invisibility, levitate, and protection from evil and good.\n\nIn addition, the Canaith mandolin can be used to cast cure wounds (3rd level), dispel magic, and protection from energy (lightning only).","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"125","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"ed817ea7-b6e5-4168-9f2f-59821fdb113b","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"219","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"98b77937-e0b7-43a7-9d0e-23696d680020","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"287","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"8122b487-07d5-4435-91ff-00cee8c6964e","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"62","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"244e4850-5fa0-408d-94c2-22c09dee95d4","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"16","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"13408314-feed-44e4-851a-e0812ea37617","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"120","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"e03864e9-12c0-4543-b5b6-08b95c0914c9","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"141","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"4a09dcf9-d24d-40e5-807b-545db7d0183a","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Instrument_of_the_Bards,_Canaith_Mandolin","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Instrument of the Bards, Canaith Mandolin","rarity":"RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"INSTRUMENT","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":2.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
