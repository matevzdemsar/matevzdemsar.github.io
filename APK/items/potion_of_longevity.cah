{"id":"item_Potion_of_Longevity","name":"Potion of Longevity","description":"When you drink this potion, your physical age is reduced by 1d6 + 6 years, to a minimum of 13 years. Each time you subsequently drink a potion of longevity, there is 10 percent cumulative chance that you instead age by 1d6 + 6 years. Suspended in this amber liquid are a scorpion's tail, an adder's fang, a dead spider, and a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened.","value":null,"valueCoin":"gp","weight":null,"weightUnit":"lb","rarity":"Very rare","type":"Potion","isAmmunition":false,"ammunitionType":null,"isMagic":true,"isCursed":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"requiresAttunement":false,"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"attunedName":null,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"effects":[],"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"jsonType":"item"}
