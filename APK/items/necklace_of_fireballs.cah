{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireball spell (save DC 15).\n\nYou can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"124","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"b838d7bf-590f-4f39-80ea-2317d9d15372","name":"Throw Bead","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Necklace_of_Fireballs","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Necklace of Fireballs","rarity":"RARE","requiresAttunement":false,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":1.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
