{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"Larger and more roughly hewn than typical figurines of wondrous power, these statuettes depict dinosaurs and related creatures from the earliest days of the world.\n\nAs an action, you can throw a prehistoric figurine of wondrous power to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself while speaking a command word, whereupon the figurine magically transforms into a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn\u0027t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn\u0027t become a creature.\n\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the bestiary for the creature\u0027s statistics.\n\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can\u0027t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine\u0027s description.\n\nJasper Tyrannosaurus Rex\nThis figurine, crafted from rare green jasper, becomes a tyrannosaurus rex for up to 1 hour. Once it has been used, it can\u0027t be used again until 14 days have passed.\n\nWhenever you command the figurine while it\u0027s in tyrannosaurus rex form (including commanding it to revert to figurine form), you must roll a d20. On a 1, you lose control of the figurine, and it becomes hostile to you and your companions until it is reduced to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to figurine form.","effects":[{"charges":1,"id":"30d9d566-8e06-4fa2-a161-c35e2204cfed","name":"Uses Left","rechargeMoment":"LONG_REST","rechargeRate":{"constant":0,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"PASSIVE"}],"id":"item_Prehistoric_Figurine_of_Wondrous_Power,_Jasper_Tyrannosaurus_Rex","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Prehistoric Figurine of Wondrous Power, Jasper Tyrannosaurus Rex","rarity":"LEGENDARY","requiresAttunement":false,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
