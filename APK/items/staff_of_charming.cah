{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 charges to cast charm person, command, or comprehend languages from it using your spell save DC. The staff can also be used as a magic quarterstaff.\n\nIf you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against an enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can\u0027t use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without the staff\u0027s intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.\n\nThe staff regains 1d8 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.","effects":[{"charges":10,"id":"105fb199-5a23-40fa-9010-13bf47582198","name":"Charges","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":2,"diceAmount":1,"diceType":"D8"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"8","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"36431c3a-95e6-407e-8639-8c325739e6c1","name":"Cast Charm Person","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"12","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"cd227d5e-9907-4b3e-a2db-16351163de6f","name":"Cast Command","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"14","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"72e11c60-5640-42c5-b4ce-e344401bab46","name":"Cast Comprehend Languages","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"charges":1,"id":"3f37718b-a23a-4db0-9ad9-0e59c384d0a2","name":"Turn Save Uses","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Staff_of_Charming","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Staff of Charming","rarity":"RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"STAFF","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":4.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
