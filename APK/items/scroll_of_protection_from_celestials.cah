{"id":"item_Scroll_of_Protection_from_Celestials","name":"Scroll of Protection from Celestials","description":"Using an action to read the scroll encloses you in an invisible barrier that extends from you to form a 5-foot-radius, 10-foot-high cylinder. For 5 minutes, this barrier prevents celestials from entering or affecting anything within the cylinder. The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on you. However, if you move in such a way that a celestial would be inside the cylinder, the effect ends. A creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by the barrier.","value":null,"valueCoin":"gp","weight":null,"weightUnit":"lb","rarity":"Rare","type":"Scroll","isAmmunition":false,"ammunitionType":null,"isMagic":false,"isCursed":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"requiresAttunement":false,"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"attunedName":null,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"effects":[],"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"jsonType":"item"}
