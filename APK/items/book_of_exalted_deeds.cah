{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.\n\nA heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book\u0027s contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book\u0027s open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can\u0027t be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.\n\nBenefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.\n\nRandom Properties\nThe Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties:\n\n- 2 minor beneficial properties\n- 2 major beneficial properties\n\nIncreased Wisdom\nAfter you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can\u0027t gain this benefit from the book more than once.\n\nEnlightened Magic\nOnce you\u0027ve read and studied the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher.\n\nHalo\nOnce you\u0027ve read and studied the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo\u0027s bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage.\n\nDestroying the Book\nIt is rumored that the Book of Exalted Deeds can\u0027t be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years.","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"modifier":{"constant":2,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"shouldPickMax":true,"stat":"WIS","type":"ADD_TO_STAT","typeStr":"ADD_TO_STAT"},"id":"c4199c24-be93-48a8-ba41-b93cf6190df3","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[{"comparator":"LOWER_THAN_EQUAL","stat":"STR","type":"STAT","typeStr":"STAT","value":22}],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"PASSIVE"}],"id":"item_Book_of_Exalted_Deeds","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Book of Exalted Deeds","rarity":"ARTIFACT","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":5.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
