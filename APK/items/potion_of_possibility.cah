{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"When you drink this clear potion, you gain two Fragments of Possibility, each of which looks like a Tiny, grayish bead of energy that follows you around, staying within 1 foot of you at all times. Each fragment lasts for 8 hours or until used.\n\nWhen you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can expend your fragment to roll an additional d20 and choose which of the d20s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against you, you can expend your fragment to roll a d20 and choose which of the d20s to use, the one you rolled or the one the attacker rolled.\n\nIf the original d20 roll has advantage or disadvantage, you roll your d20 after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.\n\nWhile you have one or more Fragments of Possibility from this potion, you canâ€™t gain another Fragment of Possibility from any source.","effects":[],"id":"item_Potion_of_Possibility","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Potion of Possibility","rarity":"VERY_RARE","requiresAttunement":false,"type":"POTION","value":2500.0,"valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":8.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
