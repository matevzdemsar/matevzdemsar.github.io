{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"The reigar who creates this piece of jewelry chooses its form: bracelet, brooch, diadem, or necklace. While the reigar wears the talarith, any weapon wielded by the reigar deals an extra 1d6 force damage when it hits.\n\nAs an action, a reigar can use its talarith to summon a golem that looks just like the reigar. The golem obeys the reigar\u0027s commands and uses the reigar\u0027s statistics, except it is a Construct that doesn\u0027t have a talarith of its own. The golem vanishes after 1 hour, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. After summoning a golem, the reigar must finish a short or long rest before this property can be used again.","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"bonus":{"constant":0,"diceAmount":1,"diceType":"D6"},"damageType":"Force","type":"SET_DAMAGE","typeStr":"SET_DAMAGE"},"id":"ddefe2e5-3da5-4c3b-ad27-1955a609e9dc","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"charges":1,"id":"12248b99-01e6-49ff-b1ac-74559aaf81ed","name":"Summon Golem Uses","rechargeMoment":"SHORT_REST","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Talarith","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Talarith","rarity":"LEGENDARY","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
