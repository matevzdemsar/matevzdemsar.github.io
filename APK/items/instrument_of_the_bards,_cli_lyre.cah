{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.\n\nYou can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can\u0027t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.\n\nYou can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.\n\nAll instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: fly, invisibility, levitate, and protection from evil and good.\n\nIn addition, the Cli lyre can be used to cast stone shape, wall of fire, and wind wall.","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"125","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"62fb4e39-63b3-4123-aa1b-ee158ec20522","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"219","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"458f16b2-1f50-44f8-950a-d4db8718c1e3","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"287","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"49b6992b-df9f-4827-8048-63dd94f2f3e9","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"62","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"3b6826f9-3da8-4c8f-a2e5-f44e721c019d","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"324","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"ab552206-8400-4eb0-a2dd-875305cbc9ef","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"334","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"477aa308-3bed-4d0e-a03f-d62c78c9f98f","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"343","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"3800c1fe-cf2a-414a-bc71-3e7d85729677","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Instrument_of_the_Bards,_Cli_Lyre","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Instrument of the Bards, Cli Lyre","rarity":"RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"INSTRUMENT","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":2.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
