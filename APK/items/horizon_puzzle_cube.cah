{"id":"item_Horizon_Puzzle_Cube","name":"Horizon Puzzle Cube","description":"A Horizon puzzle cube is an 8-inch magical cube made of gold, iron, crystal, and copper, and it is worth 5,000 gp to a sage or collector. A functioning puzzle cube can be solved with 30 minutes of work and a successful DC 25 Intelligence (Investigation) check. When the cube is solved, a 30-foot-diameter portal appears before the creature who solved the cube, leading to the northeastern platform of Horizon's Edge. The portal is two-way and remains open for 10 minutes or until a creature uses an action to change the puzzle's configuration. Puzzle cubes don't function while on Horizon's Edge, but a device somewhere in the demiplane allows a cube to function in reverse while the cube is fitted into it.","value":null,"valueCoin":"gp","weight":null,"weightUnit":"lb","rarity":"Rare","type":"Wondrous","isAmmunition":false,"ammunitionType":null,"isMagic":true,"isCursed":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"requiresAttunement":false,"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"attunedName":null,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"effects":[],"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"jsonType":"item"}
