While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.\n\nThe staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regain 1d8 + 2 charges.\n\nPower Strike\nWhen you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.\n\nSpells\nWhile holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: cone of cold (5 charges), fireball (5th-level version, 5 charges), globe of invulnerability (6 charges), hold monster (5 charges), levitate (2 charges). lightning bolt (5th-level version, 5 charges), magic missile (1 charge), ray of enfeeblement (1 charge), or wall of force (5 charges).\n\nRetributive Strike\nYou can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.\n\nYou have a 50 chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.\n\nDistance from Origin --\u003e Effect\n10 ft. away or closer --\u003e 8 × the number of charges in the staff\n11 to 20 ft. away --\u003e 6 × the number of charges in the staff\n21 to 30 ft. away --\u003e 4 × the number of charges in the staff","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"modifier":{"constant":2,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"shouldPickMax":true,"stat":"AC","type":"ADD_TO_STAT","typeStr":"ADD_TO_STAT"},"id":"81172838-4d35-4f0c-ba23-d734a94fcdae","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"PASSIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"modifier":{"constant":2,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"shouldPickMax":true,"stat":"SPELL_ATTACK_BONUS","type":"ADD_TO_STAT","typeStr":"ADD_TO_STAT"},"id":"58fc5eac-42c1-4078-ae50-7c307b7a20d3","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"PASSIVE"},{"charges":20,"id":"c9cf98c8-692d-479d-b971-b8bf709162c6","name":"Charges","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":4,"diceAmount":2,"diceType":"D8"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"233","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"f5cb247b-22c8-4734-bb4f-a512193a6c22","name":"Cast Cone of Cold (5 Charges)","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"124","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"d53fc0bd-a759-4b6e-985d-4f64e58055fa","name":"Cast Fireball (5th Lvl., 5 Charges)","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"268","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"6675f574-e1f8-41ab-8da4-9a8ca8e537be","name":"Cast Globe of Invulnerability (6 Charges)","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"282","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"650def80-e94e-44b9-a703-060be7eae55a","name":"Cast Hold Monster (5 Charges)","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"287","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"df5448fe-1294-48e8-8652-694d707a0cf0","name":"Cast Levitate (2 Charges)","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"289","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"186eb54d-4c87-451d-a9f2-1c82a0c56ca0","name":"Cast Lightning Bolt (5th Lvl., 5 Charges)","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"55","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"745841ff-7507-48b3-811f-12bbdeeefc0b","name":"Cast Magic Missile (1 Charge)","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"313","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"90825472-ec12-4986-9e6d-384dd41369e6","name":"Cast Ray of Enfeeblement (1 Charge)","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"336","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"46c5d1c3-d2c7-469c-9f88-5c434d4a4076","name":"Cast Wall of Force (5 Charges)","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Staff_of_Power","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Staff of Power","rarity":"VERY_RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"STAFF","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":4.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
