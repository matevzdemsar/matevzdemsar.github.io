{"id":"item_Gloves_of_Missile_Snaring","name":"Gloves of Missile Snaring","description":"These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you're wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.","value":null,"valueCoin":"gp","weight":null,"weightUnit":"lb","rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Wondrous","isAmmunition":false,"ammunitionType":null,"isMagic":true,"isCursed":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"requiresAttunement":true,"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"attunedName":null,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"effects":[],"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"jsonType":"item"}
