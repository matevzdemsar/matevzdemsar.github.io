{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target\u0027s turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\nThe wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand\u0027s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.","effects":[{"charges":7,"id":"b965e011-6566-44a5-9f99-cf58c15f6b25","name":"Uses","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":1,"diceType":"D6"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Wand_of_Paralysis","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Wand of Paralysis","rarity":"RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WAND","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":1.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
