{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This burnished copper breastplate looks as if it were made of interlocking gears. Merchant\u0027s scales are emblazoned across the chest.\n\nThe armor has 4 charges. You can use the charges in the following ways while wearing the armor:\n\n- Equalize: When you or a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can expend 1 charge and take a reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage or disadvantage.\n- Expunge Imbalance: As a bonus action, you can expend 2 charges to cast the Lesser Restoration spell from the armor.\nThe armor regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.\nThis armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer\u0027s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.","effects":[{"charges":4,"id":"e64e52b2-45d2-4683-a2f0-463093fc5656","name":"Charges Left","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":0,"diceAmount":1,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"PASSIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"94","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"3b2e3981-1e36-42f9-a8f7-f5e28613decd","name":"Cast Lesser Restoration (1 Charge)","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Breastplate_of_Balance","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":true,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Breastplate of Balance","rarity":"RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"ARMOR","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":20.0,"weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
