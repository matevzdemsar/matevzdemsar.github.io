At its center is set a deep-blue stone, upon which is inscribed the cloud rune.\n\nWhile wearing this circlet, you take no damage from falling. Additionally, as a bonus action, you and everything you are wearing or carrying can teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 15 feet of yourself, reappearing in a puff of shimmering clouds.\n\nInvoking the Rune\nAs an action, you can invoke the circlet\u0027s rune to assume a cloudlike form. The form lasts for 1 minute, until you are incapacitated, or until you dismiss it (no action required).\n\nWhile in cloud form, you have a flying speed of 60 feet and resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\n\nOnce the rune has been invoked, it can\u0027t be invoked again until the next dawn.","effects":[{"charges":1,"id":"708b39d2-98da-42b9-ac12-03398125ffc2","name":"Invoke Rune","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"PASSIVE"}],"id":"item_Nimbus_Coronet","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Nimbus Coronet","rarity":"VERY_RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
