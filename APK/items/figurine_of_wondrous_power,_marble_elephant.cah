{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"A figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn\u0027t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn\u0027t become a creature.\n\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.\n\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can\u0027t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine\u0027s description.\n\nMarble Elephant.\n\nThis marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can\u0027t be used again until 7 days have passed.","effects":[{"charges":1,"id":"bba8fede-4cde-44db-a7b5-6b180e199001","name":"Uses","rechargeMoment":"MANUAL","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Figurine_of_Wondrous_Power,_Marble_Elephant","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Figurine of Wondrous Power, Marble Elephant","rarity":"RARE","requiresAttunement":false,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
