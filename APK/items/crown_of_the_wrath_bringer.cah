{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This jagged iron circlet bears ornaments in the shape of the enemy rune. When worn, the crown glows with pale light as it draws upon the wearer\u0027s fury to strike opponents with vicious terror.\n\nWhen you make an attack roll against a creature and hit it while wearing this crown, you can spend and roll one of your unspent Hit Dice. The creature takes extra psychic damage equal to the number rolled.\n\nInvoking the Rune\nAs an action, you can invoke the crown\u0027s rune to cast the fear spell (save DC 15) with it; the spell has a duration of 1 minute and doesn\u0027t require concentration. Once the rune has been invoked, it can\u0027t be invoked again until the next dawn.","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"122","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"fe79853b-1c05-430a-9d70-8f933124f31d","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Crown_of_the_Wrath_Bringer","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Crown of the Wrath Bringer","rarity":"RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
