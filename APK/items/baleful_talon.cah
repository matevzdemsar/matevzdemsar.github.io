{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this hooked, obsidian dagger.\n\nWhen you hit a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 19 or 20 on the attack roll, the creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw as the dagger flares with sickly light. The creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, the creature disintegrates into dust.","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"bonus":1,"type":"SET_ATTACK","typeStr":"SET_ATTACK"},"id":"5e777bc4-e77a-4f08-aa4c-6fd83306c08f","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"bonus":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"damageType":"Magic","type":"SET_DAMAGE","typeStr":"SET_DAMAGE"},"id":"5560033f-a319-4cfa-9a14-3186d69d4985","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Baleful_Talon","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":false,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":true,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Baleful Talon","rarity":"VERY_RARE","requiresAttunement":false,"type":"WEAPON","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":1.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
