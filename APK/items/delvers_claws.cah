{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"The back of this weatherworn leather glove is adorned with three large metal hooks shaped like a mole\u0027s claws. Stitched into the glove\u0027s palm is the mountain rune.\n\nThe glove is considered a simple melee weapon with the finesse and light properties, and it deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit. While attuned to the glove, you gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed and blindsight to 15 feet.\n\nInvoking the Rune\nAs an action, you can invoke the glove\u0027s rune to bolster yourself with the sturdiness of the earth. Spend and roll a number of your unspent Hit Dice up to a maximum equal to your proficiency bonus. You then regain a number of hit points equal to the total roll plus your Constitution modifier.\n\nOnce the rune has been invoked, it can\u0027t be invoked again until the next dawn.","effects":[{"charges":1,"id":"aeb24b76-1ce1-4b22-9737-2fb150d030cf","name":"Rune Invocations Left","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"PASSIVE"}],"id":"item_Delver\u0027s_Claws","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Delver\u0027s Claws","rarity":"RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
