{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"These tinker\u0027s goggles have 3 charges. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to shoot a beam of fiery light from the goggles at a creature you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 fire damage. The goggles regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nCursed\nThe goggles are cursed, and becoming attuned to them extends the curse to you. You can\u0027t remove the goggles or end your attunement to them until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.\n\nWhenever you use the goggles\u0027 fiery beam and the target rolls a 20 on the d20 for the saving throw, the goggles expose you to a flash of violent bright light. As a result, you have the blinded condition for 24 hours.","effects":[{"charges":3,"id":"79045d0d-68d9-4357-a5f1-4a8fa57df3ce","name":"Uses Left","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":0,"diceAmount":1,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"PASSIVE"}],"id":"item_Blasted_Goggles","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Blasted Goggles","rarity":"UNCOMMON","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
