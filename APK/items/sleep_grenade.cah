Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the unconscious condition for 1 hour. The condition ends on a creature early if the creature takes damage or if another creature uses an action to shake it awake.","effects":[],"id":"item_Sleep_Grenade","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":false,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Sleep Grenade","rarity":"NONE","requiresAttunement":false,"type":"EXPLOSIVE","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
