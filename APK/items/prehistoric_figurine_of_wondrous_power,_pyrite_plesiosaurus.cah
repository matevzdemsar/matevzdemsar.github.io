{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"Larger and more roughly hewn than typical figurines of wondrous power, these statuettes depict dinosaurs and related creatures from the earliest days of the world.\n\nAs an action, you can throw a prehistoric figurine of wondrous power to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself while speaking a command word, whereupon the figurine magically transforms into a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn\u0027t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn\u0027t become a creature.\n\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the bestiary for the creature\u0027s statistics.\n\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its statuette form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can\u0027t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine\u0027s description.\n\nPyrite Plesiosaurus\nThis figurine becomes a plesiosaurus for up to 12 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can\u0027t be used again until 4 days have passed.\n\nWhile you are riding the plesiosaurus, you can use it to cast water breathing at will.","effects":[{"charges":1,"id":"bc0a8ee4-fb4b-40e3-9365-cede619a6ff7","name":"Uses Left","rechargeMoment":"LONG_REST","rechargeRate":{"constant":0,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"PASSIVE"}],"id":"item_Prehistoric_Figurine_of_Wondrous_Power,_Pyrite_Plesiosaurus","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Prehistoric Figurine of Wondrous Power, Pyrite Plesiosaurus","rarity":"UNCOMMON","requiresAttunement":false,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
