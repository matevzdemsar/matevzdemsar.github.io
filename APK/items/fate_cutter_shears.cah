{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"The blades of these pruning shears bear many nicks and dents but still cut cleanly. The shears function as a magic dagger. The weapon has the following properties:\n\n- Ever Sharp: When you hit with an attack using the shears, the target takes an extra 1d6 force damage.\n- Sever Threads: When you hit a creature with the shears, you can cut that creature\u0027s fate. Until the target finishes a long rest, attack rolls against it score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. Once this property is used, it can\u0027t be used again until the next dawn.","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"bonus":{"constant":0,"diceAmount":1,"diceType":"D6"},"damageType":"Force","type":"SET_DAMAGE","typeStr":"SET_DAMAGE"},"id":"f64e25a1-857e-40b4-b76f-34ee72724c14","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"charges":1,"id":"d7dbbd3a-9996-4d8b-9be9-08e9c1ef752d","name":"Sever Threads Uses Left","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"PASSIVE"}],"id":"item_Fate_Cutter_Shears","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":true,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Fate Cutter Shears","rarity":"VERY_RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WEAPON","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":1.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
