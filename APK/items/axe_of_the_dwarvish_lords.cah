{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"Magic Weapon\nThe Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a belt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of sharpness.\n\nRandom Properties\nThe axe has the following randomly determined properties:\n\n- 2 minor beneficial properties\n- 1 major beneficial property\n- 2 minor detrimental properties\n\nBlessings of Moradin\nIf you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:\n\n- You have immunity to poison damage.\n- The range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.\n- You gain proficiency with artisan\u0027s tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.\n\nConjure Earth Elemental\nIf you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the conjure elemental spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can\u0027t use this property again until the next dawn.\n\nTravel the Depths\nYou can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can\u0027t use this property again until 3 days have passed.\n\nCurse\nThe axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature\u0027s physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren\u0027t considered magical in nature (and therefore can\u0027t be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell.\n\nDestroying the Axe\nThe only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"bonus":3,"type":"SET_ATTACK","typeStr":"SET_ATTACK"},"id":"16a24d4f-3e10-4c00-925d-7f14dd5fedee","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"bonus":{"constant":3,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"damageType":"Magic","type":"SET_DAMAGE","typeStr":"SET_DAMAGE"},"id":"8a00adb6-0d9e-4a0c-88c8-5de7213a7280","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"234","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"9531878d-63a1-48dd-a084-775dd361c708","name":"Conjure Earth Elemental","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"217","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"cd17871d-576b-4495-a730-6bc7546b816c","name":"Teleport","rechargeMoment":"MANUAL","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Axe_of_the_Dwarvish_Lords","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":true,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":true,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Axe of the Dwarvish Lords","rarity":"ARTIFACT","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WEAPON","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":4.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
