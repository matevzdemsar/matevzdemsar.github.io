{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This gorgeous jewelry piece, crafted by the wizard Bigby himself, consists of four gold rings attached via delicate chains to a wrist cuff studded with sapphires and diamonds.\n\nRandom Properties\nThe bracelet has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table:\n\n- 1 minor beneficial property\n- 1 major beneficial property\n- 1 minor detrimental property\n\nDexterous Fingers\nWhile wearing the bracelet, you can cast mage hand.\n\nForce Sculpture\nBy focusing and channeling the bracelet\u0027s magic for 1 minute, you can create a spectral copy of a Large or smaller nonmagical object. The copy appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, and it is made of tangible but translucent force that mimics the size, weight, and other properties of the object it\u0027s copying. The copy must appear on a surface or liquid that can support it. Creatures can touch and interact with the copy as if it were a nonmagical object.\n\nThe copy is immune to all damage and can\u0027t be dispelled, but a disintegrate spell destroys it immediately. Otherwise, the copy disappears after 8 hours or when you dismiss it as an action.\n\nThe bracelet can create up to three copies and regains all expended uses at dawn.\n\nHelpful Hand\nAs an action, you can use the bracelet to cast Bigby\u0027s hand as a 9th-level spell (spell attack bonus +13). When you cast the spell this way, the spell doesn\u0027t require concentration. Once this property is used, it can\u0027t be used again until the next dawn.","effects":[{"charges":3,"id":"3e9637cb-38a1-4f0d-b0c9-d73b67860a92","name":"Create Copy Uses","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":3,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"402","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"6019d8d8-6640-409f-ae98-a4d0c8bd8b87","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Bigby\u0027s_Beneficent_Bracelet","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Bigby\u0027s Beneficent Bracelet","rarity":"ARTIFACT","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
