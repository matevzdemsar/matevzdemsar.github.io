{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This staff of polished gray wood bears numerous runes carved along its length. The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns into dust and is destroyed.\n\nWhile holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 2 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: fortune’s favor (2 charges), pulse wave (3 charges), or gravity sinkhole (4 charges).\n\nNew Possibility: If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against a spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.","effects":[{"charges":10,"id":"e2e05b51-ce49-4167-ace3-1ad171795c01","name":"Charges","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":4,"diceAmount":1,"diceType":"D6"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"437","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"e2e05b51-ce49-4167-ace3-1ad171795c01","name":"Cast Fortune’s Favor (2 Charges)","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"439","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"300c0ad8-8df2-4c82-a855-9d17d9c40878","name":"Cast Pulse Wave (3 Charges)","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"446","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"id":"84e15670-0268-48ef-816f-eef2de4e1372","name":"Cast Gravity Sinkhole (4 Charges)","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Staff_of_Dunamancy","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Staff of Dunamancy","rarity":"VERY_RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"STAFF","value":50000.0,"valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":6.0,"weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
