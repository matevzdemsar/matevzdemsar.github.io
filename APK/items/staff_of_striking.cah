{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\n\nThe staff has 10 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using it, you can expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra 1d6 force damage. The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.","effects":[{"charges":10,"id":"8d8660f8-05c9-4255-9f5c-06b79dcaa351","name":"Charges","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":4,"diceAmount":1,"diceType":"D6"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Staff_of_Striking","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Staff of Striking","rarity":"VERY_RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"STAFF","valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":4.0,"weightUnit":"OUNCES"}
