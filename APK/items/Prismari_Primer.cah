{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"The Prismari Primer is a magic textbook created at Strixhaven\u0027s Prismari College. The primer has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you make a Dexterity (Acrobatics) or a Charisma (Performance) check while holding the primer, you can expend 1 charge to give yourself a 1d4 bonus to the check, immediately after you roll the d20.\n\nIn addition, if you study the primer at the end of a long rest, you can choose one 1st-level spell from the bard or sorcerer spell list. Before you finish your next long rest, you can cast the chosen spell once without a spell slot if you are holding the primer. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.","effects":[{"charges":3,"id":"eb2dba6a-335c-4045-8e77-96e10d1299ae","name":"Charges","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":0,"diceAmount":1,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Prismari_Primer","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Prismari Primer","rarity":"UNCOMMON","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
