{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This curious-looking pistol is shaped like a large, glass bulb with a handle on the bottom and brass prongs protruding from its front. The weapon is powered by an energy cell stored in its grip. Placing a full energy cell in the pistol gives the pistol 6 charges.\n\nAs an action while holding this pistol, you can expend 1 of its charges to fire a ray of crackling energy at a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the paralyzed condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target\u0027s turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\nReplacing the Energy Cell:\n\nWhile the pistol has charges remaining, its energy cell can\u0027t be removed. Once the pistol has 0 charges, you can replace the energy cell with a new cell by using an action or a bonus action.","effects":[],"id":"item_Paralysis_Pistol","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":false,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Paralysis Pistol","rarity":"NONE","requiresAttunement":false,"type":"ADVENTURING_GEAR","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
