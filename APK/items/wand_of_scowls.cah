{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and target a Humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be forced to scowl for 1 minute.\n\nThe wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wandâ€™s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand transforms into a wand of smiles.","effects":[{"charges":3,"id":"e120860a-18d6-492f-85a3-39d4c5a89c68","name":"Charges","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":3,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Wand_of_Scowls","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Wand of Scowls","rarity":"COMMON","requiresAttunement":false,"type":"WAND","value":100.0,"valueCoin":"GOLD","weight":0.0,"weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
