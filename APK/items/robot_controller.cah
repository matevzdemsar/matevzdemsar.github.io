{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"This small handheld device features a glass pane with a glowing display that responds to your touch.\n\nThe controller is powered by an energy cell stored in the device. Placing a full energy cell in the device gives the device 3 charges.\n\nAs an action while holding this device, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause one of the following effects:\n\nControl: One Construct of your choice within 60 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the charmed condition for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the Construct obeys your verbal commands, and you and the Construct can communicate remotely with each other through the device. Whenever the charmed Construct takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\nDisrupt: Constructs of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the incapacitated condition for 1 minute. An incapacitated Construct can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n\nReplacing the Energy Cell:\n\nWhile the device has charges remaining, its energy cell can\u0027t be removed. Once the device has 0 charges, you can replace the energy cell with a new cell by using an action or a bonus action.","effects":[],"id":"item_Robot_Controller","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":true,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":false,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Robot Controller","rarity":"NONE","requiresAttunement":false,"type":"ADVENTURING_GEAR","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
