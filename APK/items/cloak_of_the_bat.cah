{"changesNameOnAttunement":false,"description":"While wearing this cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In an area of dim light or darkness, you can grip the edges of the cloak with both hands and use it to fly at a speed of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak\u0027s edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in dim light or darkness, you lose this flying speed.\n\nWhile wearing the cloak in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to cast polymorph on yourself, transforming into a bat. While you are in the form of the bat, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can\u0027t be used this way again until the next dawn.","effects":[{"actualEffect":{"stat":"STEALTH","type":"SET_ADVANTAGE","typeStr":"SET_ADVANTAGE"},"id":"311c0e6a-1a84-49d9-861b-44e73e21f3da","triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"PASSIVE"},{"actualEffect":{"spellId":"309","type":"USE_SPELL","typeStr":"USE_SPELL"},"charges":1,"id":"4e9e3b1b-25a0-4e78-8e99-143125378498","name":"Cast Polymorph","rechargeMoment":"DAWN","rechargeRate":{"constant":1,"diceAmount":0,"diceType":"D4"},"triggerCondition":{"conditions":[{"conditions":[],"type":"AND","typeStr":"AND"}],"type":"OR","typeStr":"OR"},"triggerType":"ACTIVE"}],"id":"item_Cloak_of_the_Bat","isAmmunition":false,"isCursed":false,"isCustom":false,"isEquipment":false,"isIntelligent":false,"isMagic":true,"isSpellcastingFocus":false,"isTemplate":false,"isValueMultiplier":false,"isWeightMultiplier":false,"jsonType":"item","name":"Cloak of the Bat","rarity":"RARE","requiresAttunement":true,"type":"WONDROUS","valueCoin":"GOLD","weightUnit":"POUNDS"}
