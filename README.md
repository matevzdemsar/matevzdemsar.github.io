This project is intended to provide D&D players and DMs with some useful tools while being (in a manner of speaking) ad-free. Its secondary purpose is to help me learn JavaScript.
There are three tools I intend to have, these being:
1. A tool for filtering spells, monsters and magic items by a variety of criteria (for example, being able to filter out monsters that have a burrowing speed);
2. A tool for creating characters;
3. A 3D combat simulator (with a particular focus on measuring distances between points on the battle map);

So far, the filters are mostly finished. The next step will be to attempt to make the site work better on mobile (as it stands, it looks quite ugly on mobile).
After that, some time will be devoted to looking for a better API to get data from (and adjusting the filters to accept data from it).
If this is unsuccessful, the development of the character creation tool will be delayed as class, race, feat and background data is reqiuired for character creation.
In that case, work will resume on the combat simulator.
