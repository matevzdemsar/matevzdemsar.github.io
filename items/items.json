Its interior is divided into two floors with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.\n\nEach creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.\n\nThe tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.",

Once the figurine has become a giant canary, it can't be used this way again until the next dawn.\n\nGold Dragon Form\nWhile you are missing half or more of your hit points, you can speak a different command word and the figurine becomes an adult gold dragon (see its stat block in the Bestiary) for up to 1 hour. The dragon can't use any legendary actions or lair actions. Once the figurine has become an adult gold dragon, it can't be used this way again until 1 year has passed.\n\nIn either form, the creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.\n\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each form. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it.

This isn't a power of the orb that you control.\n\nCurse\nAny Humanoid you touch while holding the orb must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. Each creature cursed by the orb bears an echo of Murgaxor's hateful thoughts, and that creature suffers from headaches that are persistent but not debilitating until the curse ends. On your turn, the orb can use an action to produce one of the following effects, targeting one or more creatures it has cursed:\n\nUnconsciousness\nThe cursed creature falls unconscious for 1 hour. The creature is roused if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.\n\nVisions of Terror\nThe cursed creature sees terrifying visions, causing it to view all creatures that aren't also cursed as dangerous monsters for 10 minutes. The cursed creature must use its action each round to make one attack against the nearest non-cursed creature. If the cursed creature has multiple possible targets, it attacks one at random. This effect ends if the cursed creature is incapacitated.\n\nAfter either of these effects ends, the affected creature is no longer cursed. The curse can also be removed from a creature with a remove curse spell or similar magic. All cases of the curse end if Murgaxor's orb is destroyed.\n\nMagical Signature\nAs a side effect of the orb's curse, the spell detect magic reveals an aura of enchantment surrounding creatures bearing the curse. This aura is distinctive, but in a way detect magic offers no further details about.\n\nDestroying the Orb\nMurgaxor's orb has AC 18; 20 hit points; immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage; and resistance to all other types of damage. If reduced to 0 hit points, the orb shatters.",

It deals an extra 2d4 radiant damage to chromatic dragons.\n\nOnce three scales have been pulled from the scarf, no more scales can be removed until the next dawn, when all the missing scales grow back.

If you make a Charisma (Intimidation) or a Charisma (Persuasion) check while holding the primer, you can expend 1 charge to give yourself a 1d4 bonus to the check, immediately after you roll the d20.\n\nIn addition, if you study the primer at the end of a long rest, you can choose one 1st-level spell from the bard or cleric spell list. Before you finish your next long rest, you can cast the chosen spell once without a spell slot if you are holding the primer. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.",

The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\n\nThe apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the following statistics:\n\n- Armor Class: 20\n- Hit Points: 200\n- Speed: 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren't extended)\n- Damage Immunities: poison, psychic\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\n\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\n\nA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table.\n\nApparatus of Kwalish Levers:\nLever --> Up --> Down\n1 --> Legs and tail extend, allowing the apparatus to walk and swim. --> Legs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus's speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed.\n2 --> Forward window shutter opens. --> Forward window shutter closes.\n3 --> Side window shutters open (two per side). --> Side window shutters close (two per side).\n4 --> Two claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus. --> The claws retract.\n5 --> Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: 8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:  7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. --> Each extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: 8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit:  The target is grappled (escape DC 15).\n6 --> The apparatus walks or swims forward. --> The apparatus walks or swims backward.\n7 --> The apparatus turns 90 degrees left. --> The apparatus turns 90 degrees right.\n8 --> Eyelike fixtures emit bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. --> The light turns off.\n9 --> The apparatus sinks as much as 20 feet in liquid. --> The apparatus rises up to 20 feet in liquid.\n10 --> The rear hatch unseals and opens. --> The rear hatch closes and seals.",

You can't use this property again until the next dawn.\n\nTravel the Depths\nYou can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.\n\nCurse\nThe axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell.\n\nDestroying the Axe\nThe only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.",

The bag weighs ½ pound plus ¼ pound for each bean it contains.\n\nIf you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.\n\nIf you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The DM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.\n\nd100 --> Effect\n01 --> 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour.\n02-10 --> A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (DM's choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d12 rounds.\n11-20 --> A treant sprouts. There's a 50 chance that the treant is chaotic evil and attacks.\n21-30 --> An animate, immobile stone statue in your likeness rises. It makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours.\n31-40 --> A campfire with blue flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours (or until it is extinguished).\n41-50 --> 1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout.\n51-60 --> 1d4 + 8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the DM's choice. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright pink smoke.\n61-70 --> A hungry bulette burrows up and attacks.\n71-80 --> A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined magic potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of the DM's choice. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days.\n81-90 --> A nest of 1d4 + 3 eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from an internal magical explosion.\n91-99 --> A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts upward. Inside is a sarcophagus containing a mummy lord. The pyramid is treated as the mummy lord's lair, and its sarcophagus contains treasure of the DM's choice.\n00 --> A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the DM's choice. The top leads where the DM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant's castle, or a different plane of existence.",

Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.\n\nInanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM determines the time and plane.\n\nIf the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.",

Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.\n\nIf the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.\n\nPlacing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Heward's handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes.

The copy appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, and it is made of tangible but translucent force that mimics the size, weight, and other properties of the object it's copying. The copy must appear on a surface or liquid that can support it. Creatures can touch and interact with the copy as if it were a nonmagical object.\n\nThe copy is immune to all damage and can't be dispelled, but a disintegrate spell destroys it immediately. Otherwise, the copy disappears after 8 hours or when you dismiss it as an action.\n\nThe bracelet can create up to three copies and regains all expended uses at dawn.\n\nHelpful Hand\nAs an action, you can use the bracelet to cast Bigby's hand as a 9th-level spell (spell attack bonus +13). When you cast the spell this way, the spell doesn't require concentration. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.",

A creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor can be restored to life only by a wish spell.\n\nWhen it devours a soul, Blackrazor grants you temporary hit points equal to the slain creature's hit point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours. As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep Blackrazor in hand, you have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.\n\nIf you hit an undead with this weapon, you take 1d10 necrotic damage and the target regains 1d10 hit points. If this necrotic damage reduces you to 0 hit points, Blackrazor devours your soul.\n\nSoul Hunter\nWhile you hold the weapon. you are aware of the presence of Tiny or larger creatures within 60 feet of you that aren't constructs or undead. You also can't be charmed or frightened.\n\nBlackrazor can cast the haste spell on you once per day. It decides when to cast the spell and maintains concentration on it so that you don't have to.\n\nSentience\nBlackrazor is a sentient chaotic neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\n\nThe weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to it, Blackrazor also understands every language you know.\n\nBlackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes three days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset.",

As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.\n\nA heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.\n\nBenefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.\n\nRandom Properties\nThe Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties:\n\n- 2 minor beneficial properties\n- 2 major beneficial properties\n\nIncreased Wisdom\nAfter you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can't gain this benefit from the book more than once.\n\nEnlightened Magic\nOnce you've read and studied the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher.\n\nHalo\nOnce you've read and studied the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo's bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage.\n\nDestroying the Book\nIt is rumored that the Book of Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years.",

Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.\n\nA creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.\n\nWhenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to neutral evil.\n\nThe Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.\n\nRandom Properties\nThe Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties:\n\n- 3 minor beneficial properties\n- 1 major beneficial property\n- 3 minor detrimental properties\n- 2 major detrimental properties\n\nAdjusted Ability Scores\nAfter you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again.\n\nMark of Darkness\nAfter you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.\n\nCommand Evil\nWhile you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the dominate monster spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can't use this property again until the next dawn.\n\nDark Lore\nYou can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check.\n\nDark Speech\nWhile you carry the Book of Vile Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite word from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take 1d12 psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes 3d6 psychic damage.\n\nDestroying the Book\nThe Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.\n\nIf a solar tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for 1d100 years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.\n\nA creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms 1d10 × 100 years later.\n\nIf all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.",

Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.",

After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.\n\nWhile lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.\n\nAlternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the gate spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.",

Explorers and pirates like them because they're fast and sturdy. Military leaders use them as command ships for the same reasons.\n\nDamselfly ship owners are a proud lot, fond of painting their ships in colorful patterns as well as customizing their vessels with special equipment. Large, private gatherings of damselfly ship owners are not uncommon; they use these get-togethers to show off their ships and to race one another through asteroid belts and other obstacle courses, either for rewards or bragging rights.",

    "description": "This artifact destroys wealth to provide light and protection. Wrought from the finest yellow gold, the lantern has four faces, and an unwavering amber flame burns within it. The faces of the lantern are fitted with faceted gemstone lenses.\n\nThe lantern is a symbol of the teachings of Daoud, who was once a priest of Istus, a god of fate. When Daoud was stripped of his possessions, he developed a radical new philosophy in his quest to understand fate. He urged followers of his ideology to eschew wealth and seek out all fortunes, good and ill, to unravel the cloth of destiny.\n\nRandom Properties\nThe lantern has the following random properties:\n\n- 2 minor beneficial properties\n- 1 major beneficial property\n- 1 minor detrimental property\n\nPrecious Fuel:\n\nThe lantern burns only one source of fuel: powdered gemstones placed in the lantern's base. The lantern can hold a maximum of 10,000 gp worth of powdered gems, and it contains 9,000 gp of fuel when found. Thereafter it attempts to burn 100 gp of fuel after each year passes, keeping the lantern burning for another year. If no fuel is available, the lantern's flame goes out. You can add more fuel to the lantern as part of a short or long rest. Once added, fuel can't be removed from the lantern's base.\n\nThe lantern's flame can't be extinguished by any means other than running out of fuel. If the lantern's flame goes out, the creature attuned to it immediately dies. One exception to this rule exists, which is \"Destroying the Lantern\".\n\nDestroying the Lantern:\n\nTo destroy the lantern, the creature attuned to it must forsake all material possessions except for the lantern and common clothes. Then the creature must willingly snuff the lantern's flame with the intention to destroy the artifact. When its flame is snuffed in this way, the lantern's gold corrodes, the lenses and remaining gemstone fuel turn to worthless sand, and the creature attuned to it is spared.\n\nRevealing Light:\n\nThe lantern sheds \"bright light\" in a 60-foot radius and \"dim light\" for an additional 60 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible while in the lantern's \"bright light\".\n\nWhile attuned to the lantern, you can use a bonus action to dim the lantern, reducing the light to \"dim light\" in a 5-foot radius, or brighten the lantern back to its normal \"bright light\" radius.\n\nLenses:\n\nWhen found, the lantern's faces display the following gem lenses: diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire. As part of a short or long rest, you can magically change any of these gem lenses to a different type of gem shown in the Lenses table. The gem lenses can't be removed from the lantern.\n\nAs an action while holding the lantern, you can burn some of the lantern's fuel to cast a spell (save DC 20) through one or more of its current gem lenses, as noted in the Lenses table. The spell's target or point of origin must be in the lantern's area of \"bright light\". If there isn't enough fuel left to cast the spell, the last of the remaining fuel is expended, and the flame goes out.\n\nLenses\n\nLens Color --> Spell --> Fuel Cost\n\nAmethyst --> Reverse Gravity --> 3,000 gp\nDiamond --> Disintegrate --> 2,000 gp\nEmerald --> Haste --> 500 gp\nJacinth --> Flame Strike --> 1,000 gp\nRuby --> Hold Monster --> 1,000 gp\nSapphire --> Fear --> 500 gp\nTopaz --> Slow --> 500 gp\nAny four colors --> Prismatic Wall --> 5,000 gp",

When the spell ends, the deck reappears in your possession.\n- Shuffling Stride: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to throw a card from the deck to an unoccupied space within 60 feet of yourself and teleport, along with any equipment you're wearing or carrying, to that space.

You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.\n\nAn illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled.

    "description": "Over the centuries since the first Deck of Many Things was created, many have sought and failed to replicate it. But some have created new cards. These forty-four additional cards are known collectively as the Deck of Many More Things.\n\nLike the Deck of Many Things, the Deck of Many More Things manifests differently on various worlds. While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a Deck of Many Things as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows you to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect.\n\nAs soon as you draw a card, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.\n\nUnless it is the Fool or the Jester card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.\n\nThe DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire. Alternatively, roll on the Deck of Many More Things table below to randomly determine what cards are drawn.\n\nDeck of Many More Things\nd100 --> Card\n01 --> Aberration\n02 --> Balance*\n03 --> Beast\n04 --> Book\n05 --> Bridge\n06 --> Campfire\n07 --> Cavern\n08 --> Celestial\n09 --> Comet*\n10 --> Construct\n11 --> Corpse\n12 --> Crossroads\n13 --> Donjon*\n14 --> Door\n15 --> Dragon\n16 --> Elemental\n17 --> Euryale*\n18 --> Expert\n19 --> Fates*\n20 --> Fey\n21 --> Fiend\n22 --> Flames*\n23 --> Fool*\n24 --> Gem*\n25 --> Giant\n26 --> Humanoid\n27 --> Jester*\n28 --> Key*\n29 --> Knight*\n30 --> Lance\n31 --> Mage\n32 --> Map\n33 --> Maze\n34 --> Mine\n35 --> Monstrosity\n36 --> Moon*\n37 --> Ooze\n38 --> Path\n39 --> Pit\n40 --> Plant\n41 --> Priest\n42 --> Prisoner\n43 --> Puzzle*\n44 --> Ring\n45 --> Rogue*\n46 --> Ruin*\n47 --> Sage*\n48 --> Shield\n49 --> Ship\n50 --> Skull*\n51 --> Staff\n52 --> Stairway\n53 --> Star*\n54 --> Statue\n55 --> Sun*\n56 --> Talons*\n57 --> Tavern\n58 --> Temple\n59 --> Throne*\n60 --> Tomb\n61 --> Tower\n62 --> Tree\n63 --> Undead\n64 --> Void*\n65 --> Warrior\n66 --> Well\n67-00 --> Roll again\n\nAberration\nYou gain telepathy within a range of 90 feet.\n\nBeast\nYou immediately transform into a random Beast with a CR of 5 or lower. Your game statistics—including your ability scores, hit points, and possible actions—are replaced by the Beast's game statistics, and any nonmagical equipment you're wearing or carrying melds into your new form and can't be used. Any magic items you're carrying drop in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your new form.\n\nYou remain transformed in this way for 2d12 days; nothing can alter your form while you're under the effects of this card, but the Wish spell can end the transformation early. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the same state you were in when you initially transformed.\n\nBook\nYou gain the ability to speak, read, and write 1d6 + 2 languages of your choice.\n\nBridge\nYou gain the ability to cast the Time Stop spell 1d3 times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nCampfire\nYou immediately gain the benefits of finishing a long rest.\n\nCavern\nYou gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You also gain the ability to move up, down, across vertical surfaces, and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.\n\nCelestial\nYou sprout a pair of softly luminescent, feathered wings from your back and gain a flying speed of 30 feet.\n\nConstruct\nA homunculus appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The appearance of the homunculus is determined by the DM, and the homunculus treats you as its creator.\n\nCorpse\nYou immediately drop to 0 hit points, have the unconscious condition, and must begin making death saving throws. Spells and other magical effects that restore hit points have no effect on you until you are stabilized. If you fail three death saving throws, you die and can be resurrected only by the Wish spell.\n\nCrossroads\nRoll a d20. If the roll is even, you age 1d10 years. If the roll is odd, you become younger by 1d10 years, to a minimum of 1 year. This effect can be undone only by the Wish spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.\n\nDoor\nYou gain the ability to cast the Gate spell 1d4 times, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nDragon\nA dragon egg appears at your feet and immediately hatches into a dragon wyrmling. The type of dragon is chosen by the DM. The wyrmling views you as its parent and is staunchly loyal to you and your allies.\n\nElemental\nYou become immune to one of the following damage types (choose immediately upon drawing this card): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.\n\nExpert\nYour Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\n\nFey\nA fey crossing opens into the Feywild, and you're immediately pulled through it, disappearing in a flash of rainbow-colored light. You draw no more cards.\n\nThe fey crossing appears as a shimmering fractal of light above the deck, and it remains open for 1 minute after the card is drawn. The precise location in the Feywild to which the fey crossing leads is determined by the DM.\n\nFiend\nA powerful Fiend appears in a nearby unoccupied space and offers you a deal. The precise nature of this deal is up to the DM, but usually the Fiend offers some material reward in exchange for you and your allies completing a task for the Fiend. The Fiend is indifferent to you and can be bargained with; it keeps its side of any bargain it makes, though it might twist the wording of any agreement to suit its purposes. If attacked, or if negotiations fail and you refuse the Fiend's offer, it returns to its home plane.\n\nGiant\nYou immediately grow 2d10 inches in height, and your hit point maximum and current hit points both increase by 20.\n\nHumanoid\nYou can immediately choose to stop drawing from the deck, regardless of how many cards you initially declared.\n\nLance\nAll your ability scores increase by 1, to a maximum of 20.\n\nMage\nYour Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\n\nMap\nAt any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can mentally name or describe an object or individual that is familiar to you. You immediately know the location of the object or individual, as well as the distance between you and the object or individual, even if the object or individual is on a different plane of existence. If you named an individual, you know if they are alive and any conditions they have. If you named an object, you know if it is broken or not. If you named a magic item that has charges, you know how many charges it has remaining.\n\nMaze\nYou gain 1d3 levels of exhaustion.\n\nMine\nA pile of 2d6 gems (each worth 5,000 gp) and 1d10 chunks of precious ore (each worth 2,500 gp) appears at your feet.\n\nMonstrosity\nA Large or larger Monstrosity with a challenge rating of 10 or less (chosen by the DM) appears in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of you. The creature is hostile toward you and attacks immediately. The creature disappears when it is killed or when you are reduced to 0 hit points. If there isn't enough space for a Large or larger creature to appear, this card has no effect.\n\nOoze\nA gelatinous cube immediately appears in your space and engulfs you. The gelatinous cube is hostile and remains until it is destroyed. If there isn't enough space for the gelatinous cube to appear, this card has no effect.\n\nPath\nYour walking speed increases by 10 feet.\n\nPit\nA pit opens beneath you. You plummet 3d6 × 10 feet, take damage from the fall, and have the prone condition.\n\nPlant\nYou gain the ability to cast Speak with Plants without using a spell slot; you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. If you have spell slots of 3rd level or higher, you can cast this spell using them. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nPriest\nYour Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\n\nPrisoner\nGlowing chains made of magical force appear and wrap around you. You have the restrained condition until the chains are destroyed or you are freed. While you have this condition, you can't cast spells, and any magic items you're wearing or carrying have their properties suppressed. You draw no more cards. The chains are immune to damage and can't be dispelled using the Dispel Magic spell or similar magic. However, a Disintegrate spell destroys the chains instantly, freeing you. Another creature can also free you by succeeding on a DC 30 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.\n\nRing\nA rare or rarer magic ring appears on your finger. If you have the attunement slots available, you're automatically attuned to the ring when it appears. The DM chooses the ring.\n\nShield\nA rare or rarer suit of magic armor that you are proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the armor. If you lack proficiency with any armor, your base AC instead now equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor.\n\nShip\nYou gain proficiency in three skills chosen by the DM.\n\nStaff\nA rare or rarer magic rod, staff, or wand appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.\n\nStairway\nYou can choose to either decrease your number of declared draws by two or receive a rare or rarer wondrous item, which appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.\n\nStatue\nYou immediately have the petrified condition as your body is transformed into marble. The petrification lasts until you are freed with the Greater Restoration spell or similar magic.\n\nTavern\nYour Charisma score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.\n\nTemple\nA deity or entity of similar power becomes bound to aid you. At any point in time between drawing the card and when you die, you can use your action to call on this entity for divine intervention, and the entity is bound to answer. The parameters and nature of this intervention are chosen by the DM. If you die without having used this intervention, the deity fulfills its obligation by casting the Resurrection spell on you. Once the entity has answered your call for divine intervention or resurrected you, the entity is no longer bound to aid you.\n\nTomb\nAt any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can cast the True Resurrection spell once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nTower\nDraw two additional cards beyond your declared number of draws. The magic of these cards doesn't immediately take effect; instead, choose one of the two additional cards to keep, returning the other to the deck. The magic of the card you keep takes effect immediately thereafter.\n\nTree\nYour skin immediately becomes rough, like tree bark. Your base AC now equals 15 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor, but you have vulnerability to fire damage. This transformation can be undone only by the Wish spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.\n\nUndead\nSomewhere on the Material Plane, a revenant rises. This revenant blames you for its existence and relentlessly hunts you to exact its revenge. The revenant exists until either 1 year passes, the revenant kills you, or you use a Wish spell to banish it permanently to the afterlife.\n\nWarrior\nYour Strength score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.\n\nWell\nYou learn three cantrips of your choice from any spell list.",

    "description": "Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.\n\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\n\nOnce a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\n\nA Question of Enmity\nTwo of the cards in a deck of many things can earn a character the enmity of another being. With the Flames card, the enmity is overt. The character should experience the devil's malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking out the fiend shouldn't be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash with the devil's allies and followers a few times before being able to confront the devil itself.\n\nIn the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone thought to be a friend or an ally. As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a dramatically appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the adventurer guessing who is likely to become a betrayer.\n\nPlaying Card --> Card\nAce of diamonds --> Vizier*\nKing of diamonds --> Sun\nQueen of diamonds --> Moon\nJack of diamonds --> Star\nTwo of diamonds --> Comet*\nAce of hearts --> The Fates*\nKing of hearts --> Throne\nQueen of hearts --> Key\nJack of hearts --> Knight\nTwo of hearts --> Gem*\nAce of clubs --> Talons*\nKing of clubs --> The Void\nQueen of clubs --> Flames\nJack of clubs --> Skull\nTwo of clubs --> Idiot*\nAce of spades --> Donjon*\nKing of spades --> Ruin\nQueen of spades --> Euryale\nJack of spades --> Rogue\nTwo of spades --> Balance*\nJoker (with TM) --> Fool*\nJoker (without TM) --> Jester\n\nVizier\nAt any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\n\nSun\nYou gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the DM determines randomly) appears in your hands.\n\nMoon\nYou are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times.\n\nStar\nIncrease one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can't exceed 24.\n\nComet\nIf you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\n\nThe Fates\nReality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\n\nThrone\nYou gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\n\nKey\nA rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon.\n\nKnight\nYou gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\n\nGem\nTwenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\n\nTalons\nEvery magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren't destroyed but do vanish.\n\nThe Void\nThis black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.\n\nFlames\nA powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\n\nSkull\nYou summon an avatar of death|dmg-a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death|dmg. A creature slain by an avatar of death|dmg can't be restored to life.\n\nIdiot\nPermanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\n\nDonjon\nYou disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can't be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\n\nRuin\nAll forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\n\nEuryale\nThe card's medusa-like visage curses you. You take a -2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\n\nRogue\nA nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.\n\nBalance\nYour mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\n\nFool\nYou lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\n\nJester\nYou gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.",

You have disadvantage on initiative rolls. This effect lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.\n\nEnd\nThis card is an omen of death. You take 2d10 necrotic damage, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This effect can't reduce your hit point maximum below 10 hit points. This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early by a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.\n\nIsolation\nYou disappear, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, and become trapped in a harmless extradimensional space for 1d4 minutes. You draw no more cards. You then reappear in the space you left or the nearest unoccupied space. When you reappear, you must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition for 1 hour as your body reels from the extradimensional travel.\n\nJustice\nYou momentarily gain the ability to balance the scales of fate. For the next 8 hours, whenever you or a creature within 60 feet of you is about to roll a d20 with advantage or disadvantage, you can use your reaction to prevent the roll from being affected by advantage or disadvantage.\n\nKnife\nAn uncommon magic weapon you're proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the weapon.\n\nLock\nYou gain the ability to cast Knock 1d3 times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\n\nMischief\nYou receive an uncommon wondrous item (chosen by the DM), or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\n\nMonster\nThis card's monstrous visage curses you. While cursed in this way, whenever you make a saving throw, you must roll 1d4 and subtract the number rolled from the total. The curse lasts until you finish a long rest, but it can be ended early with a Remove Curse spell or similar magic.\n\nMystery\nYou have disadvantage on Intelligence saving throws for 1 hour. Discard this card and draw from the deck again; together, the two draws count as one of your declared draws.\n\nNight\nYou gain darkvision within a range of 300 feet. This darkvision lasts for 8 hours.\n\nOrder\nYou gain resistance to one of the following damage types (chosen by the DM): force, necrotic, poison, psychic, or radiant. This resistance lasts for 1d12 days.\n\nStudent\nYou gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).\n\nVulture\nOne nonmagical item or piece of equipment in your possession (chosen by the DM) disappears.

While attuned to the glove, you gain a burrowing speed equal to your walking speed and blindsight to 15 feet.\n\nInvoking the Rune\nAs an action, you can invoke the glove's rune to bolster yourself with the sturdiness of the earth. Spend and roll a number of your unspent Hit Dice up to a maximum equal to your proficiency bonus. You then regain a number of hit points equal to the total roll plus your Constitution modifier.\n\nOnce the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.",

Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.",

    "description": "The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.\n\nTo attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.\n\nTo attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.\n\nRandom Properties\nThe Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties:\n\n- 1 minor beneficial property\n- 1 major beneficial property\n- 1 minor detrimental property\n\nProperties of the Eye\nYour alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:\n\n- You have truesight.\n- You can use an action to see as if you were wearing a ring of X-ray vision. You can end this effect as a bonus action.\n- The eye has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: clairvoyance (2 charges), crown of madness (1 charge), disintegrate (4 charges), dominate monster (5 charges), or eyebite (4 charges). The eye regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5% chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM's control.\n\nProperties of the Eye and Hand\nIf you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits:\n\n- You are immune to disease and poison.\n- Using the eye's X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion.\n- You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can't be surprised.\n- If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points.\n- If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice of your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.\n- You can use an action to cast wish. This property can't be used again until 30 days have passed.\n\nDestroying the Eye and Hand\nIf the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.",

Until the target finishes a long rest, attack rolls against it score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.",

Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:\n\n- The goat of traveling can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.\n- The goat of travail becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.\n- The goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 lance, and the other becomes a +2 longsword. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat's aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can't be used again until 15 days have passed.",

The chair has AC 15, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It is destroyed if reduced to 0 hit points.\n\nThe sensation of being attuned to a flying citadel helm is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one's arm or leg falls asleep, but not as intense.\n\nWhile attuned to a flying citadel helm and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell):\n\n- You can use the flying citadel helm to move the citadel through the air, up to 80 feet per round, or up to 8 miles per hour.\n- You can steer the citadel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way that a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship.\n- At any time, you can see and hear from the highest point outside the citadel as though you were at that location.\n\nIf no creature attuned to the helm is maintaining concentration, the citadel remains motionless in its space.\n\nTransfer Attunement\nYou can use an action or a bonus action to touch a willing spellcaster, whereupon that creature attunes to the flying citadel helm immediately, and your attunement to the flying citadel helm ends.\n\nCrash\nShould the flying citadel helm be destroyed, the citadel it is installed on loses power and begins to crumble. If the crumbling citadel is in the air, it descends at a rate of 30 feet per round, or 300 feet per minute. Any creature on the citadel or on the ground within 120 feet of the citadel when it lands must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 39 (6d12) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.",

The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n- The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it.

The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.\n\nTo attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.\n\nTo attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.\n\nRandom Properties\nThe Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties:\n\n- 1 minor beneficial property\n- 1 major beneficial property\n- 1 minor detrimental property\n\nProperties of the Hand\nYour alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:\n\n- Your Strength score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher.\n- Any melee spell attack you make with the hand, and any melee weapon attack made with a weapon held by it, deals an extra 2d8 cold damage on a hit.\n- The hand has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: finger of death (5 charges), sleep (1 charge), slow (2 charges), or teleport (3 charges). The hand regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the hand, it casts the suggestion spell on you (save DC 18), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you.\n\nProperties of the Eye and Hand\nIf you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits:\n\n- You are immune to disease and poison.\n- Using the eye's X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion.\n- You experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can't be surprised.\n- If you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points.\n- If a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice of your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.\n- You can use an action to cast wish. This property can't be used again until 30 days have passed.\n\nDestroying the Eye and Hand\nIf the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.",

Once you have successfully attuned to the harp, the harp resizes to suit you.\n\nStalwart Song\nWhenever you make a Charisma check while attuned to the harp, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the die as a 10.\n\nFeast of Plenty\nIf you spend 10 minutes playing the harp, you can cast the heroes' feast spell from it. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until 1d10 + 10 days have passed.\n\nSoothing Melody\nAs an action, you can use the harp to cast the calm emotions spell (save DC 19). When the spell is cast using the harp, its duration increases to 1 hour, provided you maintain concentration on the spell. This property can be used five times, and it regains all uses at dawn.\n\nSentience\nThe harp is a sentient, chaotic good object with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 20. It has hearing and darkvision to a range of 120 feet.\n\nThe harp can speak, read, and understand Common and Giant. It can also communicate telepathically with the creature attuned to it.\n\nThe harp has a dramatic and pompous personality, taking extreme pride in the quality of music produced from its strings. If the harp is shorter than 6 feet tall, it bemoans its height.",

The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.\n- As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.\n- As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage.\n- As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.\n\nRoll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.",

Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.\n\nPlacing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.\n\nThe haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\n\nPlacing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10-feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.",

    "description": "The cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it), which either can do without being attuned to the item. In its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and embossed on the outside with images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes—eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can hold up to 100 gallons of liquid.\n\nAttunement: Any Humanoid creature that attunes to the cauldron must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be aged to the point of decrepitude. In this state, the creature’s speed is halved, the range of its vision and hearing is reduced to 30 feet, and it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature will reach the end of its natural life span in 3d8 days. Only a wish spell or divine intervention can reverse this aging effect on the creature.\n\nThree hags can attune to the cauldron simultaneously, provided they have formed a coven. If the coven disbands, the attunement ends for all three hags.\n\nRandom Properties. Regardless of the form it takes, the cauldron has the following random properties:\n\n- 1 minor beneficial property (determined by rolling on the Minor Beneficial Properties table)\n\n- 1 minor detrimental property (determined by rolling on the Minor Detrimental Properties table)\n\nTHE WITCH QUEEN’S CAULDRON\n\nAs explained in the description of Iggwilv’s Cauldron, the poem titled “The Witch Queen’s Cauldron” is an incantation that hints at the time-freezing property of the artifact:\n\nEight cats perch atop eight dead attending\nEight lizards flee from eight rats scavenging\nEight toads climbing meet eight dead and falling\nEight snakes sneak under eight bats screaming\nEight eyes open, always dreaming\nAll on the cauldron that is ever seeming.\n\nGold Cauldron: The gold cauldron has the following properties:\n\n- If water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew that provides one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon of water used. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew.\nIf wine is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 10 minutes, it transforms into a magical elixir that fortifies up to four people per gallon of wine used. Any creature that imbibes the elixir gains 10 temporary hit points. Any of the elixir that isn’t consumed within 1 hour vanishes. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n- When the cauldron is filled with 90 gallons of water mixed with 10 gallons of wine, it can be used as the focus for a scrying spell. When this spell is cast using the cauldron as its focus, the target of the spell fails its saving throw automatically, and the spell works even if its caster and the target are on different planes of existence. When the spell ends, all the liquid in the cauldron vanishes.\n- Dipping the bristles of an ordinary broom into the water-filled cauldron transforms the broom into a broom of flying for 3 days. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nIron Cauldron: The iron cauldron has the following properties:\n\nYou can use an action to scream into the empty cauldron, which magically summons a swarm of bats that flies out of the cauldron and acts immediately after you in the initiative order. The swarm obeys your commands and disappears after 1 minute if it hasn’t been destroyed by then. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nIf at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall unconscious for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being charmed. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An unconscious creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nTying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water-filled cauldron transforms the branch into a wand of polymorph with 3 charges. This wand can’t recharge and crumbles to ashes when its final charge is expended. Once used, this property of the cauldron can’t be used again for 8 days.\nIf you spend 1 minute touching the cauldron with a unicorn’s horn while reciting the poem called “The Witch Queen’s Cauldron”, all creatures within 1,000 feet of the cauldron except those that are attuned to it become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is incapacitated, can’t move or speak, doesn’t age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Moreover, it can’t be moved, harmed in any way, or affected by any other magic. All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen in time. Destroying the cauldron, sending it to another plane of existence, or touching it with a unicorn’s horn for 1 minute while reciting “The Witch Queen’s Cauldron” ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an antimagic field or is touched by a unicorn’s horn.\n\nDestroying the Cauldron: The cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to damage from any source other than a flame tongue or frost brand weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic.\n\nThe destruction of Iggwilv’s Cauldron causes all hags in the multiverse to lose the Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven.\n\nReconstructing the Cauldron: If all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a wish spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties. The cauldron’s reconstruction also restores the Shared Spellcasting trait of hag covens throughout the multiverse.",

Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a legendary bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.\n\nYou can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells. Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.\n\nYou can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be charmed on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.\n\nAll instruments of the bards can be used to cast the following spells: fly, invisibility, levitate, and protection from evil and good.\n\nIn addition, the Ollamh harp can be used to cast confusion, control weather, and fire storm.",

If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one magic arrow when you pull back the string. The arrow created by the bow vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.\n\nThe bow has 8 charges for the following properties, which you can use while wielding the bow. The bow regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn.\n\nCurative Arrow\nWhen you take the Attack action using the bow, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your attacks with a blazing arrow of curative magic, which automatically hits one creature you can see within 150 feet of you. The target can then immediately spend and roll one of its unspent Hit Dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the roll plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).\n\nIf the target has no unspent Hit Dice remaining, nothing happens. You can use a curative arrow only once per turn.\n\nSpellcasting\nWhile holding the bow, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 18): create food and water (1 charge), warding bond (2 charges), guardian of faith (3 charges).",

If an attack threatens to injure the wearer, the construct can magically absorb the blow into its own body, even at a distance.\n\nA spellcaster can store a single spell within a shield guardian, which can then cast the spell on command or under specific conditions. Many a wizard has been rendered helpless by enemies, only to surprise those foes when its shield guardian unleashes potent magical power.",

A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it.

The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror's surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.\n\nIn a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror.

If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.\n\nA moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.\n\nA moonblade won't serve anyone it regards as craven, erratic, corrupt, or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind. If the blade rejects you, you make ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours. If the blade accepts you, you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.\n\nA moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served (typically 1d6 + 1). The first rune always grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Each rune beyond the first grants the moon blade an additional property. The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.\n\nMoonblade Properties\nd100 --> Property\n01-40 --> Increase the bonus to attack and damage rolls by 1, to a maximum of +3. Reroll if the moonblade already has a +3 bonus.\n41-80 --> The moonblade gains a randomly determined minor property.\n81-82 --> The moonblade gains the finesse property.\n83-84 --> The moonblade gains the thrown property (range 20/60 feet).\n85-86 --> The moonblade functions as a defender.\n87-90 --> The moon blade scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.\n91-92 --> When you hit with an attack using the moon blade, the attack deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage.\n93-94 --> When you hit a creature of a specific type (such as dragon, fiend, or undead) with the moonblade, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of one of these types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.\n95-96 --> You can use a bonus action to cause the moonblade to flash brightly. Each creature that can see you and is within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until you take a short rest while attuned to the weapon.\n97-98 --> The moonblade functions as a ring of spell storing.\n99 --> You can use an action to call forth an elfshadow, provided that you don't already have one serving you. The elfshadow appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you. It uses the statistics for a shadow, except it is neutral, immune to effects that turn undead, and doesn't create new shadows. You control this creature, deciding how it acts and moves. It remains until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss it as an action.\n00 --> The moonblade functions as a vorpal sword.\n\nSentience\nA moon blade is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\n\nThe weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed. It can communicate more explicitly, through visions or dreams, when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.",

    "description": "Roiling green mist fills this glass orb, which the exiled Strixhaven mage Murgaxor once used in foul magical experiments. Murgaxor's spirit has infused the orb, which he uses to spread a terrible curse among Strixhaven's students.\n\nSentience\nMurgaxor's orb is a sentient, chaotic evil magic item with the following properties:\n\n- The orb has an Intelligence of 20, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 16, as well as hearing and darkvision out to a range of 30 feet.\n- The orb can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature touching it.\n- At any time during your turn, the orb can cast the suggestion spell (save DC 17), targeting you or one other creature that touched the orb within the last 24 hours. This isn't a power of the orb that you control.\n\nCurse\nAny Humanoid you touch while holding the orb must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. Each creature cursed by the orb bears an echo of Murgaxor's hateful thoughts, and that creature suffers from headaches that are persistent but not debilitating until the curse ends. On your turn, the orb can use an action to produce one of the following effects, targeting one or more creatures it has cursed:\n\nUnconsciousness\nThe cursed creature falls unconscious for 1 hour. The creature is roused if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.\n\nVisions of Terror\nThe cursed creature sees terrifying visions, causing it to view all creatures that aren't also cursed as dangerous monsters for 10 minutes. The cursed creature must use its action each round to make one attack against the nearest non-cursed creature. If the cursed creature has multiple possible targets, it attacks one at random. This effect ends if the cursed creature is incapacitated.\n\nAfter either of these effects ends, the affected creature is no longer cursed. The curse can also be removed from a creature with a remove curse spell or similar magic. All cases of the curse end if Murgaxor's orb is destroyed.\n\nMagical Signature\nAs a side effect of the orb's curse, the spell detect magic reveals an aura of enchantment surrounding creatures bearing the curse. This aura is distinctive, but in a way detect magic offers no further details about.\n\nDestroying the Orb\nMurgaxor's orb has AC 18; 20 hit points; immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage; and resistance to all other types of damage. If reduced to 0 hit points, the orb shatters.",

The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.\n\nEach pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features—such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons—that are up to 10,000 cubic feet.

    "description": "Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\n\nAs the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\n\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\n\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\n\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.\n\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides.\n\nRandom Properties\nAn Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:\n\n- 2 minor beneficial properties\n- 1 minor detrimental property\n- 1 major detrimental property\n\nSpells\nThe orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.\n\nCall Dragons\nWhile you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.\n\nDestroying an Orb\nAn Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.",

If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the DM). If there aren't enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren't under your control otherwise.

If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can't hear the pipes' music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can't be swayed by the pipes' music for the next 24 hours.",

A suit of powered armor functions as a suit of normal plate armor, even when it has 0 charges remaining.\n\nActivating the Armor:\n\nAs an action, you can expend any number of the armor's charges to activate it; the armor remains active for 1 hour per charge expended. You can use a bonus action to deactivate the armor early, but doing so doesn't recover any expended charges.\n\nWhile the armor is active, you gain the following benefits:\n\nAugmented Physicality: You have advantage on Strength checks, and your carrying capacity is doubled.\n\nEnvironmental Adaptation: The armor seals airtight and provides its own atmosphere. You can breathe normally in any environment and withstand extreme temperatures, and you're unaffected by harmful gases, as well as contact and inhaled poisons.\n\nForce Field: When you would take damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the armor's charges to deploy a defensive force field. Roll 3d10 and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled.\n\nPropulsion: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the armor's charges to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute. If you're airborne when this duration ends, you fall.\n\nReplacing the Energy Cell:\n\nWhile the armor has charges remaining, its energy cell can't be removed. Once the armor has 0 charges, you can replace the energy cell with a new cell by using an action or a bonus action.",

The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can't hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\n\nWhile wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.",

    "description": "This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage roll made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.\n\nSix Buttons\nYou can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\n\nIf you press button 1, the rod becomes a flame tongue as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head (you choose the type of sword).\n\nIf you press button 2, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\n\nIf you press button 3, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\n\nIf you press button 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\n\nIf you press button 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\n\nIf you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.\n\nDrain Life\nWhen you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target rakes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nParalyze\nWhen you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nTerrify\nWhile holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.",

If you already have darkvision, the mantle increases your darkvision's range by 60 feet instead.\n- Move in Shadows: While you are in dim light or darkness, you can use a bonus action to teleport, along with anything you are wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.\n- Willful Enmity: You can cast the Antagonize spell (save DC 15) from the mantle. Once the mantle has cast the spell, it can't cast the spell again until the next dawn.",

Whether or not the shadow is snipped, this property of the scissors can’t be used again until the next dawn.\n\nThe detached shadow is rooted to the spot where it was snipped until you use a bonus action to cause it to behave in one of the following ways, either of which is possible only if you can see the shadow:\n\n- You control the shadow’s movements and can make the shadow move up to 30 feet across a solid or liquid surface, in any direction you choose (including along vertical surfaces), provided it remains within your sight at all times. The shadow is harmless and unable to be harmed, and it is invisible in darkness. It can’t speak, and it doesn’t require air, sleep, or nourishment.\n\n- You can relinquish control of the shadow, at which point it becomes autonomous and behaves as the GM wishes. It uses the shadow stat block in the bestiary, but its creature type is Fey instead of Undead.

    "description": "Using an action to read the scroll encloses you in an invisible barrier that extends from you to form a 5-foot-radius, 10-foot-high cylinder. For 5 minutes, this barrier prevents undead from entering or affecting anything within the cylinder. The cylinder moves with you and remains centered on you. However, if you move in such a way that an undead would be inside the cylinder, the effect ends. A creature can attempt to overcome the barrier by using an action to make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a success, the creature ceases to be affected by the barrier.",

If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell has no effect, and it is stored in the bottle. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an Intelligence check.

It can also propel and maneuver a ship on water or underwater, provided the ship is built for such travel. The ship in question must weigh 1 ton or more.\n\nThe sensation of being attuned to a spelljamming helm is akin to the pins-and-needles effect one experiences after one's arm or leg falls asleep, but not as painful.\n\nWhile attuned to a spelljamming helm and sitting in it, you gain the following abilities for as long as you maintain concentration (as if concentrating on a spell):\n\n- You can use the spelljamming helm to move the ship through space, air, or water up to the ship's speed. If the ship is in space and no other objects weighing 1 ton or more are within 1 mile of it, you can use the spelljamming helm to move the vessel fast enough to travel 100 million miles in 24 hours.\n- You can steer the vessel, albeit in a somewhat clumsy fashion, in much the way that a rudder or oars can be used to maneuver a seafaring ship.\n- At any time, you can see and hear what's happening on and around the vessel as though you were standing in a location of your choice aboard it.\n\nTransfer Attunement\nYou can use an action to touch a willing spellcaster. That creature attunes to the spelljamming helm immediately, and your attunement to it ends.\n\nCost of a Spelljamming Helm\nA spelljamming helm propels and steers a ship much as sails, oars, and rudders work on a seafaring vessel, and a spelljamming helm is easy to create if one has the proper spell. Create spelljamming helm has a material component cost of 5,000 gp, so that's the least one can pay to acquire a spelljamming helm.\n\nWildspace merchants, including dohwars and mercanes, typically sell a spelljamming helm for substantially more than it cost to make. How much more depends on the market, but 7,500 gp would be a reasonable demand. A desperate buyer in a seller's market might pay 10,000 gp or more.",

On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.\n\nIf you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature's control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature's Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.\n\nIf the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the gate spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a portable hole, the DM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.\n\nd100 --> Result\n01-50 --> The sphere is destroyed.\n51-85 --> The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.\n86-00 --> A spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence.",

While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.\n\nThe staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains 2d8 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regain 1d8 + 2 charges.\n\nPower Strike\nWhen you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d6 force damage to the target.\n\nSpells\nWhile holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: cone of cold (5 charges), fireball (5th-level version, 5 charges), globe of invulnerability (6 charges), hold monster (5 charges), levitate (2 charges). lightning bolt (5th-level version, 5 charges), magic missile (1 charge), ray of enfeeblement (1 charge), or wall of force (5 charges).\n\nRetributive Strike\nYou can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.\n\nYou have a 50 chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.\n\nDistance from Origin --> Effect\n10 ft. away or closer --> 8 × the number of charges in the staff\n11 to 20 ft. away --> 6 × the number of charges in the staff\n21 to 30 ft. away --> 4 × the number of charges in the staff",

While you're holding it, you can use an action to produce one of the following effects. Once the staff has produced an effect, it can't produce that effect again until the next dawn.\n\nOrb of Lightning:\n\nYou create a Small orb of lightning in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of yourself. You concentrate on this orb as if concentrating on a spell. As a bonus action, you can move the orb up to 20 feet in any direction.\n\nWhen your concentration ends, or when a creature enters the orb's space or starts its turn there, the orb detonates in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking lightning damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one; the orb's base damage is 6d6, and if at the end of your turn the orb hasn't detonated, its damage increases by 2d6, to a maximum of 10d6.\n\nStaff to Snake:\n\nYou throw the staff to an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, and the staff becomes a giant poisonous snake. The snake is under your control and shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours.\n\nOn your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you don't have the incapacitated condition. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.\n\nIf you use a bonus action to speak the command word again, or if the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, the snake reverts to staff form in its current space.\n\nThunderclap:\n\nYou point the staff skyward, producing a fearsome thunderclap. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the deafened and frightened conditions until the end of your next turn.",

    "description": "This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls.\n\nThe staff has 50 charges for the following properties. It regains 4d6 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff regains 1d12 + 1 charges.\n\nSpell Absorption\nWhile holding the staff, you have advantage on saving throws against spells. In addition, you can use your reaction when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell's level. However, if doing so brings the staff's total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).\n\nSpells\nWhile holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: conjure elemental (7 charges), dispel magic (3 charges), fireball (7th-level version, 7 charges), flaming sphere (2 charges), ice storm (4 charges), invisibility (2 charges), knock (2 charges), lightning bolt (7th-level version, 7 charges), passwall (5 charges), plane shift (7 charges), telekinesis (5 charges), wall of fire (4 charges), or web (2 charges).\n\nYou can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the staff without using any charges: arcane lock, detect magic, enlarge/reduce, light, mage hand, or protection from evil and good.\n\nRetributive Strike\nYou can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.\n\nYou have a 50 chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.\n\nDistance from Origin --> Damage\n10 ft. away or closer --> 8 × the number of charges in the staff\n11 to 20 ft. away --> 6 × the number of charges in the staff\n21 to 30 ft. away --> 4 × the number of charges in the staff",

When one of these properties is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nLightning\nWhen you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the target to take an extra 2d6 lightning damage.\n\nThunder\nWhen you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of thunder, audible out to 300 feet. The target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the end of your next turn.\n\nLightning Strike\nYou can use an action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff's tip in a line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nThunderclap\nYou can use an action to cause the staff to issue a deafening thunderclap, audible out to 600 feet. Each creature within 60 feet of you (not including you) must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't deafened.\n\nThunder and Lightning\nYou can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties at the same time. Doing so doesn't expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.",

While holding the rod, you can use an action to direct each tentacle to attack a creature you can see within 15 feet of you. Each tentacle makes a melee attack roll with a +9 bonus. On a hit, the tentacle deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If you hit a target with all three tentacles, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature's speed is halved, it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions for 1 minute. Moreover, on each of its turns, it can take either an action or a bonus action, but not both. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.",

The energy then detonates into a 10-foot-radius sphere of turbulent wind and thunder centered on that point, and each creature in that sphere must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw.

The tongues pinned to the covers of the four copies came from other spellcasters who crossed Vecna. The first few pages of each tome are filled with indecipherable scrawls. The remaining pages are blank and pristine.\n\nIf you can attune to this item, you can use it as a spellbook and an arcane focus. In addition, while holding the tome, you can use a bonus action to cast a spell you have written in this tome, without expending a spell slot or using any verbal or somatic component. Once used, this property of the tome can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nWhile attuned to the book, you can remove the tongue from the book's cover. If you do so, all spells written in the book are permanently erased.\n\nVecna watches anyone using this tome. He can also write cryptic messages in the book. These messages appear at midnight and fade away after they are read.",

The projection disappears at the end of your turn. Once you use this bonus action, it can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nCurse\nThis armor is cursed, and attuning to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you're unwilling to part with the armor. Taking it off fails to end the curse. While cursed in this way, you feel disconnected from your body, continuously hearing whispers that call for you to join them. Whenever you finish a long rest while cursed, you must make a DC 11 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, your soul is drawn from your body and trapped in an object on a different plane of existence. The object and location of this object are chosen by the DM (but might be the House of Cards). While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert and doesn't age or require sustenance. Destroying the object frees your soul; otherwise, only a Wish spell can restore your soul to your body.\n\nMade from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.",

    "description": "The ghastly Wand of Orcus rarely leaves Orcus's side. The device, as evil as its creator, shares the demon lord's aims to snuff out the lives of all living things and bind the Material Plane in the stasis of undeath. Orcus allows the wand to slip from his grasp from time to time. When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.\n\nMade from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand's presence.\n\nAny creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes 10d6 necrotic damage. On a failed save, the creature dies and rises as a zombie.\n\nIn the hands of one who is attuned to it, the wand can be wielded as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The wand deals an extra 2d12 necrotic damage on a hit.\n\nRandom Properties\nThe Wand of Orcus has the following random properties:\n\n- 2 minor beneficial properties\n- 1 major beneficial property\n- 2 minor detrimental properties\n- 1 major detrimental property\n\nThe detrimental properties of the Wand of Orcus are suppressed while the wand is attuned to Orcus himself.\n\nProtection\nYou gain a +3 bonus to Armor Class while holding the wand.\n\nSpells\nThe wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: animate dead (1 charge), blight (2 charges), circle of death (3 charges), finger of death (3 charges), power word kill (4 charges), or speak with dead (1 charge). The wand regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn.\n\nWhile attuned to the wand, Orcus or a follower blessed by him can cast each of the wand's spells using 2 fewer charges (minimum of 0).\n\nCall Undead\nWhile you are holding the wand, you can use an action to conjure skeletons and zombies, calling forth as many of them as you can divide 500 hit points among, each undead having average hit points. The undead magically rise up from the ground or otherwise form in unoccupied spaces within 300 feet of you and obey your commands until they are destroyed or until dawn of the next day, when they collapse into inanimate piles of bones and rotting corpses. Once you use this property of the wand, you can't use it again until the next dawn.\n\nWhile attuned to the wand, Orcus can summon any kind of undead, not just skeletons and zombies. The undead don't perish or disappear at dawn the following day, remaining until Orcus dismisses them.\n\nSentience\nThe Wand of Orcus is a sentient, chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 16, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\n\nThe wand communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal and Common.\n\nPersonality\nThe wand's purpose is to help satisfy Orcus's desire to slay everything in the multiverse. The wand is cold, cruel, nihilistic, and bereft of humor. In order to further its master's goals, the wand feigns devotion to its current user and makes grandiose promises that it has no intention of fulfilling, such as vowing to help its user overthrow Orcus.\n\nDestroying the Wand\nDestroying the Wand of Orcus requires that it be taken to the Positive Energy Plane by the ancient hero whose skull surmounts it. For this to happen, the long-lost hero must first be restored to life—no easy task, given the fact that Orcus has imprisoned the hero's soul and keeps it hidden and well guarded.\n\nBathing the wand in positive energy causes it to crack and explode, but unless the above conditions are met, the wand instantly reforms on Orcus's layer of the Abyss.",

    "description": "This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and choose a target within 120 feet of you. The target can be a creature, an object, or a point in space. Roll d100 and consult the following table to discover what happens.\n\nIf the effect causes you to cast a spell from the wand, the spell's save DC is 15. If the spell normally has a range expressed in feet, its range becomes 120 feet if it isn't already.\n\nIf an effect covers an area, you must center the spell on and include the target. If an effect has multiple possible subjects, the DM randomly determines which ones are affected.\n\nThe wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.\n\nd100 --> Effect\n01-05 --> You cast slow.\n06-10 --> You cast faerie fire.\n11-15 --> You are stunned until the start of your next turn, believing something awesome just happened.\n16-20 --> You cast gust of wind.\n21-25 --> You cast detect thoughts on the target you chose. If you didn't target a creature, you instead take 1d6 psychic damage.\n26-30 --> You cast stinking cloud.\n31-33 --> Heavy rain falls in a 60-foot radius centered on the target. The area becomes lightly obscured. The rain falls until the start of your next turn.\n34-36 --> An animal appears in the unoccupied space nearest the target. The animal isn't under your control and acts as it normally would. Roll a d100 to determine which animal appears. On a 01-25, a rhinoceros appears; on a 26-50, an elephant appears; and on a 51-100, a rat appears.\n37-46 --> You cast lightning bolt.\n47-49 --> A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 30-foot radius centered on the target. The area becomes heavily obscured. The butterflies remain for 10 minutes.\n50-53 --> You enlarge the target as if you had cast enlarge/reduce. If the target can't be affected by that spell or if you didn't target a creature, you become the target.\n54-58 --> You cast darkness.\n59-62 --> Grass grows on the ground in a 60-foot radius centered on the target. If grass is already there, it grows to ten times its normal size and remains overgrown for 1 minute.\n63-65 --> An object of the DM 's choice disappears into the Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the target, and no larger than 10 feet in any dimension.\n66-69 --> You shrink yourself as if you had cast enlarge/reduce on yourself.\n70-79 --> You cast fireball.\n80-84 --> You cast invisibility on yourself.\n85-87 --> Leaves grow from the target. If you chose a point in space as the target, leaves sprout from the creature nearest to that point. Unless they are picked off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours.\n88-90 --> A stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each worth 1 gp, shoots from the wand 's tip in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each gem deals 1 bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the gems is divided equally among all creatures in the line.\n91-95 --> A burst of colorful shimmering light extends from you in a 30-foot radius. You and each creature in the area that can see must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\n96-97 --> The target's skin turns bright blue for 1d10 days. If you chose a point in space, the creature nearest to that point is affected.\n98-00 --> If you targeted a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If you didn't target a creature, you become the target and must make the saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is instantly petrified. On any other failed save, the target is restrained and begins to turn to stone. While restrained in this way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the target is freed by the greater restoration spell or similar magic.",

Each creature of your choice on the ground within 60 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.\n\nSupernatural Awareness\nWhile you are holding the weapon, it alerts you to the location of any secret or concealed doors within 30 feet of you. In addition, you can use an action to cast detect evil and good or locate object from the weapon. Once you cast either spell, you can't cast it from the weapon again until the next dawn.\n\nSentience\nWhelm is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 15.
