Hit: 7 (2d6) acid damage.\n- 2: Alchemist's Fire: The kobold throws a Alchemist's Fire (flask).  4 to hit, range 5/20 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (1d4) fire damage at the start of each of the target's turns.

Hit: 5 (1d10) acid damage, and the target is covered in slime until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the slime off. A target covered in the slime takes 5 (1d10) acid damage at the start of each of its turns.\n- 5: Rot Grub Pot: The kobold throws a clay pot into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it, and it breaks open on impact.

Hit: 1 piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw, taking 4 (1d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n- 7: Skunk in a Cage: The kobold releases a skunk into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of it. The skunk has a walking speed of 20 feet, AC 10, 1 hit point, and no effective attacks. It rolls initiative and, on its turn, uses its action to spray musk at a random creature within 5 feet of it.

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Once the skunk has sprayed its musk, it can't do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.\n- 8: Wasp Nest in a Bag: The kobold throws a small bag into a 5-foot-square space within 20 feet of it.
